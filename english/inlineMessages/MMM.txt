 There are stairs leading up.
 There are stairs leading down.
 Therefs a transport device.
 Therefs a sign.
Alright, Ifm gonna look for monsters.
(Look look look)
Unfortunately, I couldnft find any monsters.
Unfortunately, I couldnft find any monsters.
hRance-sama, therefs no knob on this door.h
hWhat a half-assed door.h
hIfm gonna destroy it.h
(Bam)
My splendid Special Kick hit the door.
hOwowow.. Tch, didnft work, huh?h
hRance-sama, therefs something written on the door.h
hItfs a little faded and hard to read.
 Umm, letfs see...h
h..ange.. color....h
hWhat the heckfs that mean?h
hWho knows? Itfs old writing, so maybe it doesnft mean
 anything anymore.h
hGuess so.h
The door wonft open.
We left the huge tower.
The door wonft open.
The door wonft open.
The door wonft open.
hTherefs a transport device, Rance-sama.
 Should we use it?h
hLetfs see??h
hAlright, letfs go!h
hYes.h
We stood in the center of the magic circle on the ground.
Ascend stairs?
hWhatfs wrong, Sill?
 Hurry up.h
hRance-sama, the stairs are blocked with rubble.
 We canft use them.h
hWhat? Well grow a spine and move the rubble.h
hOkay, heave-ho, heave-ho!h
........
hRance-sama, therefs too much of it for me to move.
 I donft think we can go upstairs.h
h.....Tch.h
We gave up on going up the stairs.
Ascending to higher floor.
Descend stairs?
Descending to lower floor.
Doesnft look like therefs any reason to search thoroughly
here.
(Beeeep)
(Booooop)
(Beep beep boooop)
hUwah, what the hell!!?h
I was sent flying by mysterious sound effects and some
kind of shock wave.
hWhat happened, Rance-sama?h
hWhat do you mean? That huge shock wave....
 Sill, are you okay??h
hYes, Ifm fine...h
The shock waves were enough to send ME flying, and yet
Sillfs standing there like everythingfs perfectly fine.
How dare she!
hShit, what the hellfs going on?
 Stupid.. uwah!h
(Beeeep)
(Booooop)
(Beep beep boooop)
Mysterious shock waves assaulted me again and I
collapsed.
And yet... Sillfs fine.
hRance-sama, are you okay?h
hShut up! Why only me..?h
hI felt it too.h
hMe too.h
hI hurt tooo... I canft go on!
 Waah, waah!h
hWhat does this mean, Rance-sama?
 Itfs only me...?h
.. hItfs because youfre a mage, Sill-chan.h
hShizuka-san!h
Just then, Masou Shizuka, one of my women, appeared.
hLooks like Ifve found Sill-chan and Rance.h
hHey, Shizuka!
 What the heck are you doing here?h
hWhat I do is my own business, isnft it?
 Itfs got nothing to do with you.h
hIt does too! Hurry up and join my party already!h
hNo way! Why do I have to join your party?h
hBecause Ifm fighting day and night for world peace!
 Why the hell wouldnft you help me out!?h
hYou? Fighting for world peace..? Funny.
 Anyway, I have something I need to do here.h
hWhat!?h
hThis Toushin Toshi is a treasure trove of magic
 knowledge. I might be able to fulfill my lifelong dream
 here.
 I donft care about Leazas and Helman anymore.h
hWhat the hell are you talking about?h
hUmm.. Shizuka-san, about what you were saying earlier
 about me being a mage..?h
hOh right, that.
 Therefs a Mage Barrier on this passageway.
 Only mages can come through it.h
hGaaaah, how annoying!
 Just join my fucking party!h
hNo.h
hThatfd be a waste of precious studying time.
 Well, see you.h
Shizuka disappeared down the passageway.
hWait, you bitch!!h
(Beeeep)
(Booooop)
(Beep beep boooop)
I was blown away with a strange sound.
hShit!h
(Beeeep)
(Booooop)
(Beep beep boooop)
hShit, Ifm pissed!h
h.....h
hGeez, what the hell are you doing out here?
 Youfre being so loud I canft concentrate on my
 research!h
hPlease just stop interfering with me.h
hWhat was that, you bitch!?
 Who the hell do you think I am!?h
hRance, and?h
hYeah, Ifm Rance-sama!h
hWell then, Ifm busy, so see you.h
Shizuka tried to leave quickly.
hWait a second.h
hWhat do you want?h
hThere should be medicine for dragons somewhere in this
 tower.
 Dfyou know anything about that?h
h..............h
hOh yeah... Yeah, there is.
 There was headache medicine and cold medicine, and also
 stomach medicine for dragons for some reason.h
hI see. Then Shizuka, I order you.
 Go get the dragon cold medicine.h
hWhy do I have to!!?h
hWell, whatever.
 Ifll go get it, so stop bothering me.h
hRance-sama, now we can get the dragonfs cold medicine.
 Itfs a good thing Shizuka-san was here.h
hIdiots sure are useful.h
hIdiots.. Idiots??h
hShizuka, of course.
 Shefs amazingly stupid to defy me.h
h...I donft think thatfs true...h
hSill, fd you say something?h
hNo, nothing.h
hHmm, Shizukafs sure taking her sweet time.
 If she canft even run this simple an errand, shefs worse
 than a grade schooler.h
hWhat an incompetent woman.h
hWhofs incompetent?h
hAh, youfre finally back.
 Youfd better have what I told you to get.h
hIs that the attitude you take when you ask someone a
 favor??
 Seriously.h
hI got it for you.
 Here, Dragonfs Cold Medicine.h
I received Dragonfs Cold Medicine from Shizuka.
hThank you very much, Shizuka-san.h
hWell then, see you, Sill-chan.
 Good luck protecting him.h
hWhat was that!!?h
Giggling, Shizuka disappeared into the passageway.
I was wearing the Fake Magefs Clothes, so I could get
through, but..
(Beeeep)
(Booooop)
(Beep beep boooop)
hKya!h
hOwah!h
hOw, what, what!?h
hHey, what was that!?h
My incompetent subordinates got caught in the trap and
couldnft follow me.
I was able to get through the trap safely because I was
wearing the Fake Magefs Clothes.
When I tried to go through the passageway...
(Beeeep)
(Booooop)
(Beep beep boooop)
I was sent flying by creepy noises and a shock wave.
hShit!h
hRance-sama, it looks like you have to be a mage to get
 through here.h
"Shut up. Starting now, Ifm a mage!
 I have a magic eye beam that makes beautiful girls fall
 in love with me! So let me through!h
(Beeeep)
(Booooop)
(Beep beep boooop)
hUwah, shit!
 Didnft work, huh?h
hItfs too bad, Rance-sama.h
hSill, I hope youfre not feeling all superior right now.h
hEh? Of course not.h
hNo, you definitely are!
 You looked at me with a face like fI can get through
 fcause Ifm a mage! Isnft that great?fh
hYoufre wrong, Rance-sama!
 I wasnft thinking that at all!h
hShut it.h
(Hit hit hit hit)
(Kick kick kick kick wham)
h*Sob* *sob* *sob*.h
I took out my anger on Sill.
hEh...? Rance.h
I ran right into Shizuka, who was walking through the
passageway, carrying a book.
hGahahahahahaha, Rance-sama appears!h
hSill-chan appears too!h
hHow? Howfd you get in here, Rance?
 Only mages should be able to!h
hNothingfs impossible for me!h
hAnyway, youfre joining my party.
 Get over here.h
hNo.h
hWhaaat!?h
hIfm researching magic in this Toushin Toshi.
 And Ifm going to obtain incredible power!h
h.......h
hSo I donft have time to mess around with you.
 See you.h
hIsnft that a little mean, Shizuka?
 Letfs all work together and...h
hMaria, you were a good friend, but wefre not destined to
 walk the same path in life.h
hShizuka....h
With that, Shizuka ran off.
hMagic research, my ass.
 Shefs such a spoiled brat.h
hIfm definitely gonna catch her and punish her!h
