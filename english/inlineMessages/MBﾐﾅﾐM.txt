ÅhHigh Level God....? Never heard of it.Åh
ÅhYou mean you donÅft know my name..?Åh
ÅhNope, you just look like a ripe lady to me.

(Billow billow billow billow)
A strange, green smoke enveloped my body.

But if I do this carelessly, I could lose a level. Hmmmm.
ThereÅfs a pedestal.

pedestal.
ÅhRance-sama, why donÅft we try leaving the Bronze Bell on
 this pedestal?Åh
Leave the Bronze Bell?
ÅhAlright, do it.Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
Sill pulled the Bronze Bell out of her item bag and left

ThereÅfs nothing particularly unusual.
ÅhItÅfs just normal water, Rance-sama.
 ThereÅfs nothing particularly strange about it.Åh

While I was happily peeing, the lake started stirring.

Octoman ÅhBut you wonÅft be able to defeat the elite of us

After an especially intense splash, more of them
appeared... No, this oneÅfs a little different.
ÅhRance-sama!Åh
ÅhLooks like this oneÅfs a little different.
 Still an octopus, of course.Åh
Octoman ÅhChop, chop!

I kicked the prone Octoking.
Octoking ÅhOur great species was.. defeated?Åh
ÅhHmph, who the fuck thinks you octopi are the greatest
 species in the world?Åh
ÅhArgh, take this!Åh
Octoking Åh........Åh
ÅhYou guysÅfre second rate.
 Second rate, you got it?Åh
Octoking Åh*Sob* *sob* *sob*.Åh
ÅhWell, take this as a lesson to throw away any grand
 ideas about standing up against me.Åh
Octoking ÅhChop!Åh
ÅhYou Octomen are working for me from now on, got it?Åh
Octoking ÅhYes.Åh
ÅhGood. Obedience is good.
 ItÅfs the secret to a long life.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, why donÅft you ask them about the key?Åh
ÅhWhy not?Åh
ÅhHey, there should be an S Key around here. Know anything
 about it?Åh
Octoking ÅhChop, chop, chop!Åh
Octoking ÅhNope.Åh
ÅhYou better not be lying.
 IÅfll kill your entire species if you are.Åh
Octoking ÅhIÅfm not lying, sir.
          IÅfve never heard of an S Key.Åh
ÅhHmmmm?Åh
Octoking ÅhAlthough it might be in the dungeon past here.Åh
ÅhAnd how do we get past here?Åh
Octoking ÅhLeave it to me.
          *Tweeeeeet*.Åh
The Octoking played a note on a flute and Octomen started
appearing one after another from the water, forming a
bridge for us.
Octoking ÅhPlease take this path....Åh
ÅhAlright, thereÅfs gotta be something past here.Åh
ÅhRance-sama appears!
 Make me a bridge, octopi!!Åh
Octoman ÅhChooop!Åh
My Octomen made me a bridge.
ÅhAlright.Åh
Rance ÅhGahahahahaha, itÅfs impossible, thereÅfs no fuckinÅf way!

I stripped SanakiaÅfs clothes off.
