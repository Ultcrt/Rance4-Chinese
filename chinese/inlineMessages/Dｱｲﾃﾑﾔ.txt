Yocchan ÅhOh, Owner, welcome.
         Please make yourself at home.Åh
ÅhSure.Åh
I wandered around the store arrogantly and leaned against
the counter.
I entered YocchanÅfs shop.
Yocchan ÅhAnkoropii!Åh
ÅhAnkoropii!Åh
ÅhAnkoro???Åh
Yocchan ÅhWelcome to YocchanÅfs shop!Åh
I entered YocchanÅfs shop.
Yocchan ÅhAnkoropii!Åh
Alright, IÅfll answer her.
What should my response to ÅhAnkoropiiÅh be?
Åh.......Åh
I didnÅft really get it, so I kept quiet.
Yocchan ÅhAnkoropii!Åh
ÅhAnkoropii!Åh
Yocchan ÅhAnkoropii!
         Welcome.Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu, pabuu.Åh

Affection dropped 1 point.
ÅhYou want a beating, lady?!!Åh
Yocchan Åh??

ÅhNo, I mean like IÅfm gonna make ya cry.Åh
Yocchan ÅhThen will you tell me a moving story?Åh
ÅhNo, thatÅfs not it.Åh
Yocchan ÅhWelcome.Åh
Yocchan ÅhOh, this time youÅfve brought your girlfriend
         with you.Åh
ÅhHello.Åh
Yocchan ÅhToo bad, I was kinda thinking I would be your
         girlfriend if you didnÅft have one, Rance-san...Åh
ÅhWhatÅfs that!?
 This girlÅfs just my slave.
 SheÅfs not my girlfriend.Åh
ÅhSo go out with me.Åh
ÅhRance-samaa.. no waay...Åh
ÅhShut up, you be quiet.Åh
(Hit)
Åh......Åh
ÅhSo letÅfs become lovers and spend our days having sex.Åh
Yocchan ÅhCan I, Mr. Reagan?Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu...Åh
Yocchan ÅhMr. Reagan says I canÅft during work.Åh
ÅhAlright, then outside of work time!
 When do you close shop?Åh
Yocchan ÅhWeÅfre a 24-hour business.
         Sorry.Åh
Åh...........Åh
Is she making fun of me..?
I entered YocchanÅfs shop.
Girl ÅhAnkoropii!Åh
Åh..........Åh
Girl ÅhAnkoropii!!Åh
Åh........Åh
Wh.. whatÅfs with this weird girl... I.. I donÅft get her.
IÅfm surprised that she managed to surprise me like this.
ÅhWh..what??Åh
Girl ÅhBzzt, youÅfre a first timer then, kid?
      This is the first time youÅfve come to YocchanÅfs
      shop, right?Åh
ÅhYeah, so what?
 And anyway, whatÅfs with having an attitude like that
 with a customer?Åh
Girl ÅhBooo, youÅfre the worst.
      YouÅfre a savage, huh?Åh
ÅhWhaat!!Åh
Girl ÅhWorst, worst, worst, worst!Åh
Strange Creature ÅhPabuu, pabuu, pabuu.Åh
Åh..........Åh
Girl ÅhI guess you canÅft help it if itÅfs your first time.
      There are certain manners you have to follow when
      you shop at YocchanÅfs.
      IÅfll explain them, so listen closely.Åh
Åh..This is kinda annoying, but I guess IÅfll listen.Åh
Girl ÅhFirst, IÅfll introduce myself.
      My name is Yocchan.Åh
ÅhWhat a weirdo. Putting -chan on her own name.Åh
Yocchan ÅhThatÅfs not it.
         If you put a -chan after my name, itÅfd be
         Yocchan-chan, and a -san would be Yocchan-san.Åh
Yocchan ÅhNext is him.Åh
Yocchan indicated the strange creature.
ItÅfs a creepy-looking pudding-colored thing clinging to
the table.
Yocchan ÅhThis is Mr. Reagan, the owner of the shop.Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu.. pabuu...Åh
ÅhTh.. this weird thing!!?
 No way.Åh
Yocchan ÅhTsk, tsk, tsk.
         Mr. ReaganÅfs the richest man in town.
         HeÅfs also my employer.Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu.. pabuu.Åh
ÅhHmmmm?Åh
Yocchan ÅhAnd this is the most important thing.
         You must never disobey Yocchan within this
         shop.Åh
ÅhWhy.Åh
Yocchan ÅhThe items in this shop are priced according to a
         special Yocchan Rate.
         So if you disobey me, prices will skyrocket.Åh
Åh...How arbitrary...Åh
Yocchan ÅhIf you donÅft like it, you donÅft have to buy
         anything.
         Of course, this is the only shop in this town.Åh
ÅhOoh...Åh
Yocchan ÅhIf youÅfre a good kid, IÅfll sell you stuff cheap.
         You can be good, canÅft you?Åh
Yocchan ÅhHello.Åh
ÅhYo, your green hair is beautiful again today.
 Yup, IÅfd give it 98 points.Åh
Yocchan ÅhNot 100?Åh
ÅhNo way.Åh
Yocchan ÅhHmmmm, well, whatever.
         More importantly, please buy a lot.Åh
ÅhIf youÅfve got good stuff and itÅfs cheap.Åh
Yocchan ÅhWe only sell good, cheap stuff.Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu.Åh
Yocchan ÅhWelcome.
         Oh, Rance-san.Åh
Reagan Åh.......Åh
Yocchan ÅhWhat is it, Mr. Reagan?
         Why are you scared?Åh
ÅhWhatÅfs up?Åh
Yocchan ÅhMr. ReaganÅfs scared..
         HeÅfs foreseeing something scary happening....Åh
ÅhForeseeing... He can do that??Åh
Yocchan ÅhWell he IS rich.
         Oh, IÅfm scared, I wonder whatÅfll happen..Åh
Yocchan ÅhWelcome. Oh, itÅfs a customer!Åh
ÅhYeah, IÅfm a customer.
 WhatÅfs so weird about that??
 If customers have stopped coming Åfcause youÅfre too
 arrogant, thatÅfs your own damn fault.Åh
Yocchan ÅhThatÅfs not it.
         The shopÅfs super popular.
         But I havenÅft had any customers all day today.
         I wonder if something happened?Åh
ÅhDid something happen.. you mean you donÅft know?Åh
Yocchan ÅhKnow what??Åh
ÅhMonsters just attacked the town, you know.
 The townÅfs in a huge panic like itÅfs been flipped upside
 down.
 Of course, I, as an ally of justice, defeated them all.Åh
Yocchan ÅhHmm, that happened?
         Then I should increase the price of emergency
         food and survival kits and make some easy
         money.Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu, pabuu.Åh
Åh...........Åh
This is a shop that I own.
ItÅfs a little cramped, but you can really feel its
refinement, since itÅfs my shop.
ItÅfs a cramped item shop with a bunch of random items
lying all over the place.
She works at my shop.
So sheÅfs a woman I can use freely.
SheÅfs kinda weird sometimes, but sheÅfs got a nice body,
so I allow it.
SheÅfs cute, but sheÅfs definitely weird.
Her personality is pretty warped.
But sheÅfs got a nice body.
SheÅfs kinda stupid, but sheÅfs got a nice body, so itÅfs
fine.
SheÅfs nice and pretty and plump.
ItÅfs a strange creature.
But.. seems like itÅfs rich.
Yocchan ÅhDo you need something, Owner?Åh
Yocchan ÅhBuy something, Åfkay?Åh
ÅhYo, I dealt with that Dust Hanny.Åh
Yocchan ÅhReally? Thank you!Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu.Åh
Looks like my affection rankÅfs gone way up.
StuffÅfll be a little cheaper now.
Yocchan ÅhHey, Åfd you deal with that bilker Hanny?Åh
ÅhNot yet.Åh
Yocchan ÅhHeÅfs not gonna get away with this, is he, Mr.
         Reagan?Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu.Åh
Yocchan ÅhRance-san, I have another favor to ask of you.
         Is that okay?Åh
ÅhAgain?Åh
Yocchan ÅhIs it okay??Åh
ÅhWell, itÅfll depend on what it is, but IÅfll listen.Åh
Yocchan ÅhThe thing is, thereÅfs a Hanny whoÅfs defaulted on
         a loan.Åh
ÅhHey now, you sell to monsters?Åh
Yocchan ÅhAnyone whoÅfll pay is a customer.Åh
ÅhBut he didnÅft.Åh
Yocchan ÅhRight, so I canÅft let him live.
         IÅfve gotta kill him as an example.Åh
ÅhYou say some scary things.Åh
Yocchan ÅhHe should be hiding somewhere in the West Tower.
         His name is Dust.
         IÅfll leave it to you.Åh
ÅhI havenÅft said IÅfm doing it yet.Åh
Yocchan ÅhPlease. There.Åh
Yocchan ÅhRance-san, I have a favor to ask..
         Is that okay?Åh
ÅhWhatÅfs the favor? ItÅfll depend on what it is.Åh
Yocchan ÅhWell.. IÅfd like you to deliver something that
         was mail ordered.Åh
ÅhYou can deliver it yourself, canÅft you?
 DonÅft slack off, do your damn job.Åh
Yocchan ÅhThe person who ordered it is named Happy Fukuda,
         but I donÅft know where he lives.Åh
Åh...Ask him his stupid address next time.Åh
Yocchan ÅhPlease deliver it.
         If you deliver it successfully, my affection
         will shoot up!Åh
If I remember correctly.. if her affection goes up,
everythingÅfll be cheaper. Alright, letÅfs do it.
ÅhFine, IÅfll deliver it.Åh
Yocchan ÅhThank you, Rance-san.
         These are the goods, a ÅfPintel 486Åf.Åh
ÅhWhatÅfs this little round rock thing??Åh
Yocchan ÅhI donÅft really know, but I think itÅfs computer
         parts.Åh
ÅhHmmm, this is?Åh
I spun it around.
Yocchan ÅhYou shouldnÅft be rough with it.
         ItÅfs worth 2,000 gold.Åh
ÅhWhat, this rock is??Åh
Yocchan ÅhAnyway, please deliver it to Mr. Happy Fukuda.Åh
Yocchan ÅhHurry up and get out of here and deliver that
         Pintel 486.Åh
ÅhShut up, let me shop a little more.Åh
Yocchan ÅhDid you deliver that Pintel 486?Åh
ÅhHm, what are you talking about?Åh
Yocchan ÅhUgh, I asked you, didnÅft I?
         To deliver that Pintel 486 to Mr. Happy Fukuda?Åh
ÅhOh, I remember.
 I made a promise like that, huh.. right.Åh
Yocchan ÅhSo..?Åh
ÅhNot yet.Åh
Yocchan ÅhDid you deliver the Pintel 486?Åh
ÅhYeah, I handed it over to that gloomy Happy Fukuda.Åh
Yocchan ÅhThank you, Rance-san. YouÅfre the best.Åh
YocchanÅfs affection increased.
Reagan ÅhPabuu, pabuu, pabuu.Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuuuuuuu.Åh
Reagan Åh...Pabuu.Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu, pabuu, pabuupabuu, pabuu, pabuu,
        pabuu, pabuu, pabuu.Åh
Åh......Åh
Yocchan ÅhThanks so much for playing with the owner, Mr.
         Reagan.
         IsnÅft that nice, Owner?Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu.Åh
Yocchan ÅhIÅfve changed my opinion of you a little,
         Rance-san.Åh
YocchanÅfs affection increased 250 points.
ÅhThen whatÅfs your affection at right now?Åh
Yocchan ÅhLetÅfs see, Rance-san ranks at....Åh
Yocchan ÅhOwner.Åh
Yocchan ÅhI love Rance-san a lot.
         I want to give my everything to him.Åh
ÅhI see, I see.Åh
Yocchan ÅhSo all the things in the shop are free.Åh
Yocchan ÅhI love you.
         I think IÅfd like to live together.Åh
ÅhI see, I see.Åh
Yocchan ÅhSo Rance-san can buy at my best prices for ten
         minutes.Åh
Yocchan ÅhA good person.
         YouÅfre a Good Guy.Åh
ÅhOf course.Åh
Yocchan ÅhAll items are half off.Åh
Yocchan ÅhA regular person.Åh
Åh.....Åh
Yocchan ÅhIÅfll sell everything at its regular price.
         ThatÅfs obvious, huh?Åh
Yocchan ÅhAn asshole.Åh
ÅhWhaat!Åh
Yocchan ÅhI hate you, so IÅfll sell everything at twice
         its usual price.Åh
Yocchan ÅhA super asshole.Åh
ÅhHmph, so what.Åh
Yocchan ÅhI loathe you, so IÅfll sell everything at four
         times its usual price to harrass you.Åh
Yocchan ÅhI hate you so much I could kill you.
         Frankly, I detest you.Åh
ÅhHey, why go that far..?Åh
Yocchan ÅhI want you to go broke, so IÅfm selling you
         everything at eight times its usual price.Åh
Yocchan ÅhYou need something, Owner?Åh
Yocchan ÅhWe have a variety of items.
         What would you like?Åh
         MoneyÅF 
ÅhAre you for sale too?Åh
Yocchan ÅhIÅfm not.Åh
ÅhThen whatÅfs with this option?
 It says [Buy, Yocchan], doesnÅft it?Åh
Yocchan ÅhThis means buying YocchanÅfs Shop.Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu.Åh
Yocchan ÅhMr. Reagan, the owner, says he could consider
         selling the shop at a certain price.Åh
ÅhWell I donÅft have any use for a shop.
 Or does anything come with when you buy the shop?Åh
Yocchan ÅhWell, letÅfs see, all of the items.. and me, the
         clerk.. would be the accessories, I guess.Åh
ÅhWhat, you come with it? You mean it?Åh
Yocchan ÅhOf course. You canÅft have a shop without someone
         to tend it after all.Åh
ÅhAlright, sold.Åh
Yocchan ÅhBut you canÅft buy it with money.Åh
Yocchan ÅhMr. Reagan will sell it to you for his favorite
         Chernen Powder.Åh
Yocchan ÅhYouÅfre buying YocchanÅfs Shop?Åh
ÅhRight, IÅfm buying.Åh
Yocchan ÅhThen can you pay the Chernen Powder?Åh
...Rance wasnÅft carrying Chernen Powder.
ÅhSill, the stuff.Åh
ÅhYes, Rance-sama.Åh
Sill pulled the (Chernen Powder) out of the item bag and
handed it to me.
ÅhThatÅfs fine, right?
 IÅfll be taking the shop and Yocchan with it.Åh
Yocchan ÅhWhat do you say, Mr. Reagan?Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu, pabuu.Åh
Yocchan ÅhYes, I understand.
         Then the shop is sold.Åh
ÅhLooks like negotiations are complete.Åh
Yocchan ÅhYes, then the Chernen Powder...Åh
I handed the Chernen Powder over to Yocchan.
Yocchan ÅhHere you go, Mr. Reagan.
         ItÅfs your favorite, Chernen Powder.Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu... uuu...Åh
Åh........Åh
Yocchan ÅhAs of today, Rance-san is now the owner.
         Please take care of me.Åh
ÅhI see, IÅfm the owner, hm?
 Fufufu, IÅfve finally obtained the shop.Åh
ÅhCongratulations, Rance-sama.Åh
Yocchan Åh........Åh
Yocchan ÅhNot buying? ThatÅfs too bad.Åh
Yocchan ÅhOne 
, yes?
         ThatÅfll be 
 gold.
         Would you like to buy it?Åh
Bought 
.
Yocchan ÅhThank you very much.Åh
Yocchan ÅhYou donÅft have enough money.
         Go home if youÅfre poor, okay?Åh
Yocchan ÅhYes, we have many dangerous weapons.Åh
Yocchan ÅhWe have many different kinds of armor.
         Which one would you like?Åh
Yocchan ÅhWhich medicine would you like?Åh
Yocchan ÅhEveryday items, just in case you need them.
         YouÅfve got nothing to lose by having them.Åh
Yocchan ÅhBargains, eh? You sure know where to look.
         WeÅfve got some good ones today.Åh
Tch, I canÅft steal any more Seirogan.
ItÅfs ludicrous that I should have to go so far as to take
my money out and buy things. IÅfll receive them for free.
ÅhOh, whatÅfs.. that?Åh
Yoccahn ÅhEh, what, what?Åh
I nabbed a (Seirogan) while Yocchan wasnÅft looking.
Obtained Seirogan.
Apparently taking things without paying for them is
something called Åhshoplifting,Åh but such words naturally
donÅft apply to me.
Because, of course, everything in this world belongs to
me from the start.
ÅhGahahahahahahaha..!Åh
Yocchan Åh??Åh
I really want to do it now.
I wanna go one round and feel refreshed.
ÅhSo let me do you.Åh
Yocchan ÅhSo? What do you mean, Owner?Åh
ÅhShut up. If I say I wanna stick it in, you turn around
 and get your ass ready.Åh
Yocchan ÅhYessir.Åh
Yocchan ÅhHere you go, Owner.Åh
Yocchan opened her legs, exposing her *beeep* to me, and tempted me.
Rance ÅhAlright, the ownerÅfs gotta personally make sure of his staffÅfs
       condition!Åh
I inserted my raging hyper weapon into Yocchan. (Thrust)
Yocchan ÅhAhn... Owner, youÅfre the best.Åh
Rance ÅhGahahahahaha, great.
       YouÅfre the best too!!Åh
(Slap slap slap)
I had a good time.
Yocchan ÅhPhew, OwnerÅfs so strong.
         My legs and hips are so tired.Åh
ÅhGahahahahahaha, work hard now.Åh
IÅfm feeling horny.
Suddenly hot blood has collected between my legs and is
about to explode.
I wanna do her, I wanna do her, I wanna do her...
But if I fuck her, thereÅfs the danger of her hating me
and making stuff harder for me to buy.
...No, wait.
Even if I start off by forcing her, she could fall madly
in love with me because of my amazing technique.
Then sheÅfd think way better of me.
To fuck or not to fuck.. that is the question.
IÅfll go with my...
....Bear it.. Men have to bear iiit.
Yocchan ÅhWhatÅfs up, Rance-san? YouÅfve been making a
         pretty funny face for a while now??Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu.Åh
Shit, sitting there all smug not understanding my
suffering.. one day IÅfll fuck that smirk off your face.
Of course itÅfs Åhfuck.Åh
Holding back on what you want to do is bad for your
health.
Opening up holes in your stomach from stress is for
stupid losers.
ÅhYocchan.Åh
Yocchan ÅhWhat is it?Åh
ÅhLet me fuck you three times.Åh
Yocchan ÅhNo way, donÅft ask such weird questions.Åh
ÅhHmmm, maybe I phrased that wrong.
 Let me try again.Åh
Yocchan Åh...?Åh
ÅhIÅfm gonna fuck you three times, you bitch!!Åh
I assaulted Yocchan.
Yocchan ÅhKyaaaa!!
         What are you doing!!Åh
ÅhWhat indeed!
 A super fun what!!! Gahahahahahahaha!Åh
I pushed Yocchan down in the back of her shop.
Yocchan ÅhKyaaa, you pervert!!Åh
Rance ÅhShut up, itÅfs your fault for tempting me!Åh
Yocchan ÅhI didnÅft tempt you!Åh
Rance ÅhNo, you did.Åh
Yocchan ÅhI did not!Åh
Rance ÅhYou did too!
       ThatÅfs why IÅfm turned on!Åh
Yocchan ÅhThatÅfs ridiculous!Åh
I closed her noisy lips with my special Shut Up Deep Kiss.
Yocchan ÅhUgh......Åh
Now that IÅfve shut her lips, sheÅfs mine.
While groping her breasts noisily, I attack her pussy from over her
panties.
YocchanÅfs resistance grows weaker as I continue my caresses.
IÅfve beaten her completely with my technique.
SheÅfs gotten wet enough, so I should put it in soon.
I moved her panties aside and rammed my hyper weapon into her flower
garden.
Take my attack of love!!
         (Squelch)
(Raaaaaaaam)
(Ramramramram.....)
Yocchan ÅhAhn... ah.. oh.. ahn.Åh
(Thrust thrust thrust thrust)
Rance ÅhUhohohohoho...!Åh
Yocchan ÅhAaaah... aaaahn...!Åh
Rance ÅhOoh...Åh
(Spuuuurt!!)
Yocchan ÅhAaaaaahn!Åh
............
ÅhPhew, IÅfm satisfied.Åh
Yocchan ÅhI haaaaate you, Rance-san!Åh
Seems like her affectionÅfs dropped.
But even if prices rise, I guess IÅfm satisfied as long as
I can fuck.
ÅhSee ya.Åh
Reagan ÅhPabuu...Åh
I left YocchanÅfs shop.
