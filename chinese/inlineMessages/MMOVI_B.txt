here.
hRance-sama, look...!h
Looks like therefs someone in the passageway.
I peeked out so as not to be seen.
hToh!h
hHeh heh heh!h
hItfs those guys....h
hThe Tousho Dio and Replica-san.
 I wonder what theyfre doing?h
hProbably a date.h
hA date??h
hRight, the two Tousho are in love.
 One of fem might be giving the other a love letter.h
h...Thatfs not what it looks like.
 They seem to be arguing.h
hI bet one of fem found out the other one was cheating.
 And now theyfre arguing about it.h
h..........h
hI wonft let you through, Dio.
 Upsilon must not be moved.h
hHeh heh heh, lecturing me?
 You do foolish things, girl.h
hYou canft. If you insist, youfll have to get past me.h
hThen thatfs what Ifll do.h
hIfve no choice!h
hHeh heh heh, do you really think you can beat the
 strongest?h
hKuh....h
hBut itfs no fun fighting a Tousho.
 I like seeing the fear of death on my opponentsf faces.h
h.......h
hAll we are are brains after all.
 At least amuse me with your voice.
 A voice trembling with terror.h
hKuh.. ah.. ah...!h
hHeh heh heh, looks like my claws have reached a part of
 your brain.
 Youfll die soon.h
hAh.. ah.. Freak-sama...h
hYes, youfll die.
 Heh heh heh heh.....h
hWell done, Dio.
 Ifll praise you.h
h..........h
hThis only happened because you got in my way, pathetic
 female Tousho.
 Kehya, kehya, kehya..!h
hNow, letfs go.h
hRight.h
hRance-sama...!h
hFufufu, what a loser.
 Since they fought amongst themselves, wefre down to only
 one Tousho now.h
hBut, Rance-sama!
 I didnft think Replica was our enemy.. I feel kind of
 sorry for her.h
hShe blocked my path.
 Anyway, wefre following the Helman guys.h
hThey must be after the N Key.
 Theyfll be pissed if we get it before them, so letfs
 hurry.h
hYes.h
