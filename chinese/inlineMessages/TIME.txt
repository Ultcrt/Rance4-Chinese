ÅhYes.Åh
ÅhWell then, IÅfll mark this spot, Rance-sama.Åh

(Scratch scratch)
Sill drew a mark on the ground.
ÅhThen letÅfs use a Return Bonsai to get back to town.Åh
I held a Return Bonsai in both of my hands and spun it
carefully, 2, 3 times.
Then when I rubbed the middle of the Return Bonsai, light
shone out from it.
ÅEÅEÅEÅEÅEÅEÅE(Return!!)ÅEÅEÅEÅEÅEÅEÅEÅE.
When I realized it, I was already back in town.
Well then, letÅfs head to the diner.
ÅhItÅfs almost nighttime, Maria.Åh
ÅhOh, is it?
 Time sure flies, huh?Åh
ÅhYeah, we should probably head back soon.Åh
ÅhLetÅfs head back, Maria.
 We should head to bed for the night.Åh
ÅhEh, is it already that late?Åh
ÅhYep, and IÅfm tired.
 Too much workÅfs bad for your health.Åh
ÅhThen letÅfs use a Return Bonsai to get back.Åh
I held a Return Bonsai in both of my hands and spun it
carefully, 2, 3 times.
A divine light shone from the Return Bonsai.
