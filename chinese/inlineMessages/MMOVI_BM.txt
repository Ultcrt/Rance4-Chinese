...A monster attacked.
Leave the room?
Itfs a column storing magic energy.
hPhew....
 Is this the last of them?h
hYes, Rance-sama.
 Congratulations.h
hWell, Freak.
 Upsilonfll stop now, right?h
hIndeed.
 I imagine Upsilonfs tuckered out due to energy
 shortage.h
hGahahahahaha!
 Now all wefve gotta do is take our time killing it.h
hUmm, Freak-san?
 What will happen to Alicia-san?h
hThe girl who was the energy source, yes?
 The shackles of the device will have been released, so
 we should be able to rescue her now.h
hLetfs go save her, Rance-sama.h
hSure, wefve taken care of everything else.
 Might as well go save her and get some dirty time in.h
h..........h
hWhatfs up, gramps? Got somethinf to say?h
hSomethingfs strange...h
hWhat is?? Your face?h
hIt sure is a weird face.
 Gahahahahahahahahahaha!!h
hThe Toushin Toshifs not stopping.
 It should have stopped by now......h
h......h
hWhat is it? I thought you said we just had to destroy
 these columns.h
hIndeed, I thought so too.. It should..h
hNo, it should stop soon.
 Therefs no way it could move without energy.h
hWe did all that work, so if it doesnft stop, therefll be
 trouble.h
hRance-sama, Alicia-san....h
Therefs a weird-ass slate.
hWe just need to destroy this column, yeah?h
hYes. If we crush all of these, Upsilon should be nothing
 more than a figurehead.h
hAlright, Ifm gonna destroy it.h
hDeryaaaaaaaaaaa!!
 Rance Attatatatatatatataccccckk!!h
(Crack)
With my intense blow, the magic column shattered.
Therefs a giant sphere about two meters in diameter.
hItfs a very big magic sphere, Rance-sama.
 So the people who made this Toushin Toshi could make
 such huge magic spheres too.h
hYeah, it sure is big.
 Hmm, it looks pretty fun too.h
hHuh?h
hIfd like one for my house.
 Alright Sill, carry it home on your shoulder.h
hRance-sama, I canft carry something this huge.
 Itfs impossible.h
hTch, youfre never any use when it really counts.h
