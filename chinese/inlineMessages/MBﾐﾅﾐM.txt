 ideas about standing up against me.h
Octoking hChop!h
hYou Octomen are working for me from now on, got it?h
Octoking hYes.h
hGood. Obedience is good.
 Itfs the secret to a long life.h
hRance-sama, why donft you ask them about the key?h
hWhy not?h
hHey, there should be an “ì•”èoú around here. Know anything

Octoking hChop, chop, chop!h
Octoking hNope.h
hYou better not be lying.
 Ifll kill your entire species if you are.h
Octoking hIfm not lying, sir.

hHmmmm?h
Octoking hAlthough it might be in the dungeon past here.h
hAnd how do we get past here?h
Octoking hLeave it to me.
          *Tweeeeeet*.h
The Octoking played a note on a flute and Octomen started
appearing one after another from the water, forming a
bridge for us.
Octoking hPlease take this path....h
hAlright, therefs gotta be something past here.h
hRance-sama appears!
 Make me a bridge, octopi!!h
Octoman hChooop!h
My Octomen made me a bridge.
hAlright.h
Rance hGahahahahaha, itfs impossible, therefs no fuckinf way!
       You canft possibly win against me like that!h
Sanakia hSh... shit!h
Rance hWell then, Ifll proceed according to our promise!
       Now letfs strip!h
I stripped Sanakiafs clothes off.

Sanakia h*Gasp*... Stop..!!h
I held Sanakia and pierced down into her with my raging hyper weapon.
Rance hMmm, grazie!

Sanakia hWhat are you.. *gasp*..!h
Rance hYoufre so tight!
