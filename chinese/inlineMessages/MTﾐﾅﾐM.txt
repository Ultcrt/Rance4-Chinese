...A monster attacked.
Leave the room?
ƒƒƒHeEeY!!
   TAMAAA, when the hell are you
   going to be done cleaning!!?„„„
hNyagh!
 ....B-Bosssss..!h
hHm.
 Hey you, the crone with the ridiculous face!h
hHm?
 Who is this mannerless whelp, Tama?h
hSome sorta amazinf, famous adventurer, he says.
 I havenft heard af him though.h
hHey, ridiculous-faced crone,h
hIsnft it an adultfs job to overlook the tiny mistakes of
 a little girl like this and to not work her so hard?h
hYeah, I feel sorry for her.h
hHmph. First of all, I have a perfectly usable name, and
 itfs Frostvine.h
hAnd second, who the hellfs a little girl?
 I dunno what the creature told you, but shefs a monster
 cat whofs been alive for several decades now.h
hAck!h
hNyafufufufufu.
 Well if ya say it so straightforward-like, Ifll get
 embarrassed.h
hMeow, meow, MEOW!h
hYoufre dead.h
hKyaa!
 Please wait a second, Rance-sama!h
hNyeah!h
hNow, now.
 Shefs annoying, but shefs something like a troublesome
 grandkid of mine, since Ifve got no relatives.h
hHmph.
 Why the hell are you living in a place like this
 anyway?h
hAhaaa, I get it.
 Youfre a monster, arenft you?
 Hurry up and become my experience points!h
hThink about a witch like me living in town for a second,
 bonehead.h
hNo matter how I tried to explain, Ifd be hunted down.
 I can do my magic research freely here and Ifm never
 short materials either.h
hWhat kind of magic research are you doing here,
 Frostvine-san?h
hUfufufufu.. Are you interested?h
hWhatever, just tell us!! Fro..whatever.h
hFROSTVINE!!
 Now listen well.h
hI lost my parents when I was very young.
 Having no family left, I was taken in by distant
 relatives.h
hCfmon, letfs go, Sill.h
hListen to your elders every once in a while!
 Now where was I... But that family had a lot of
 children already.h
hNo matter how much money my uncle was able to make, they
 couldnft spare enough to give somebody elsefs kid nice
 clothes and toys..h
h...What are you trying to say here?h
hSo, I started thinking...
 When I grow up, Ifll make an amazing toy that wonft lose
 to the toys the other children get!h
hI see. And? Did you make it?h
hHowever.. No matter how much I thought about it, I just
 couldnft come up with anything good. Ifve made hundreds
 of dolls until now, and none of them have satisfied me.h
ƒƒƒƒ!!!BUT THEN!!!„„„„
hGAH, you surprised me!h
hI thought...
 No matter how well-made a doll is, itfll always lose to
 the real thing.h
hIf you want a pet, but you buy a stuffed animal, youfll
 be unsatisfied, right?
 So I decided to make the ultimate doll.h
hThe ultimate doll? Like a Dutch Wife?h
hWell, something like that.
 But thatfs not all!h
hSomething infinitely close to a human, but without a
 human will of its own, the ideal artificial lifeform...h
hThatfs my [Athena].h
hA-thena? What the heckfs that?h
hAtena?h
hItfs the name I thought up.
 Itfs cute, isnft it?h
hSo did you make the thing?h
hNo.. I still havenft completely succeeded.
 How many years has it been..?h
hUnfortunately, Ifve ended up in this profession while
 doing all this.h
hIf you havenft fcompletelyf succeeded yet..
 have you partially succeeded?h
hYes, I did manage to complete one doll, but it was a
 failure in the end.h
hI tried too hard to make her perfect and ended up
 creating something like a copy of a human.
 Drat, just thinking about it makes me so angry...h
hWhat?
 Did you kill her? Youfre worse than terrible.h
hThat would have been better.
 Of all things, Athena ran off with a Ham Bambara!h
hShe might even be reproducing with monsters somewhere
 right now.
 What a pathetic story.. phew.h
hThe mother of a monster, eh? Then you really are a
 monster too!
 Ifll help you out!h (Shing)
hW-wait,h
hIfve finally figured out what I need after half a
 century of research.
 Thatfs right! Can I ask you a favor?h
hWill you hear me out?h
hNo way. Hurry up and become my experience.h
hGraah! Fine, fine!
 Hmph, I was planning on giving you a reward if you
 helped me out, but now I wonft!h
hWhat? A reward? Is it something good?
 I guess I could listen if it is.h
hWell, I guess I could at least listen.h
hListen well now.h
hWhat she needs to be improved is a human heart.. the
 power to think, and a calculation computer..h
hShe needs those things, but no will of her own.
 Itfs difficult to get this kind of balance right.h
hYou talk too much, crone.h
hAnd youfre an annoying brat...h
h*Ahem*.. The most difficult part of the process is
 perfecting this mental portion..
 Ifve tried every method I could think of.h
h..But none of them worked.h
h...This is annoying. Are you still going?h
hHowever!!
 Ifve finally found the components I need!
 Theyfre [Angelfs Nectar] and [Devilfs Nectar]!h
hIf itfs an item called fnectarf in a game like this,
 itfs gotta be the kinda dirty thing you couldnft get out
 of a hag like this no matter how hard you squeezed!h
hYou want me to hit you, you brat?
 Yeah, itfs exactly the dirty thing youfre thinking of!
 HMMMMPH!!h
hSo what kinda reward would I get if I managed to deliver
 this stuff to you?h
hYoufre using the strongest warrior in the world as a
 fuckinf gofer.
 Itfd better be something impressive.h
hOf course.
 This time, the great Frostvine will finally succeed!h
hAnd as your reward, Ifll give you my [‰ë“T›P2†]
 prototype as a present.h
hShefd better be fuckinf useful though.
 Just so you know, a super beautiful man like mefs got no
 shortage of nighttime partners.h
hShefd better have some other amazing features.h
hFufufu, just listen.h
hShefs got a great body and a great face, both brains and
 beauty, fortitude and sincerity, and she sings and
 dances and fights! Thatfs [‰ë“T›P2†].h
h...And this is a secret, but shefll have a D.P.S.
 function too, despite the copyright!
 ...Thatfs my plan anyway.h
hHeheh...
 Well, I guess I can indulge the whims of the elderly
 every once in a while.h
hIfll leave it to you.
 Ifll be waiting.h
hThis is ‰ë“T›P2†, right, hag?h
hYep. Shefs beautiful, just like me, right?
 Isnft she nice?h
hYeah, shefs pretty good-looking, the complete opposite
 of a crone like you.h
h*Sigh*....h
Ifm looking forward to the finished product.
Itfs a mysterious machine the hag was using.
‰ë“T›P2† was born from this thing, huh..?
Hmm.
hIfm back, hag.h
h*Gasp*, there wasnft another defect, was there?
 ...Ifm kind of losing confidence in myself here...h
hItfs fine, Granny.
 We just came to visit today.h
hYeah, it took some work, but shefs not bad.
 The sex wasnft too great though.
 Ifm unsatisfied.h
hThatfs not all ‰ë“T›P2†fs for, you know...h
hNow listen here.
 The production concept behind ‰ë“T›P2† was
 originally...h
hGaaaaaaah, whatever, whatever!
 Ifd rather eat a shoe than listen to another one of your
 stupid explanations, hag!h
hGood one, high five!h
h....
 You two sure are a good combination.
 *Sniffle*, youfre my only ally, little lady..h
hOf course!
 Ifm on your side, Grann...h
hSill!!h
h...*Sniffle*.
 Sorry, Granny.h
hOh, itfs fine.
 Just take care of my ‰ë“T›P2†.h
hYOUUU FUCKIIINf CROOONE!
 *Sniffle*!h
hWh-what is it?
 What happened this time..?h
ƒƒYEOWCH!!„„
hHEY!! Donft hit your elders like that!
 Youfll break something!h
hItfs not theeere, she doesnft haaave ooone!
 Itfs all slippery and hairless! If it were just the hair
 thing, Ifd be able to deal, but therefs no slit!h
hWhat are you gonna do about my rampaging, raging hyper
 weapon!!?h
hGWAH!
 What the hell are you showing an old woman!?
 Put that thing away!!h
hWhoops, I was so upset, I forget to put it away. I went
 and showed it to an old crone who probably hasnft seen
 one in hundreds of years. What a waste.h
hWhatever!! Just hurry up and fix it!
 And I want a good one! I wonft be satisfied with
 anything else! One that lubricates and that squeezes!h
hYeah, yeah, I got it. You sure know how to work a witch
 to death.
 But why does she have these defects?h
hMm,
 mime mafu.. (Omitted)
 Cfmon, good *beep*!!!h
hDo you have to dance every time to make the fuckinf
 spell work?h
(Spin spin spin)
hOkay, Athena, lemme see.h
hYeah, yeah`n! *Flip*.h
h..Maybe I should have given her a shred of shame...h
hUuugh... Ifm getting all horny!
 Thatfs it! Wefre doinf it heeeeere!!h
hYeaaah!h
hKya, Rance-sama!h
hHEY!! YOU TWO!!
 KNOCK IT OFF!!!
 Get outta here!h
hBeeatit, beeatit!!

hƒƒWAH!!„„
 What, you again? ..Donft surprise me like that.h
hShefs got no nipples! No nipples!
 ‰ë“T›P2†! What the hellfs perfect about that!?
 Shefs perfectly defective!h
hHeh?
 Oh, thatfs right.
 Well thatfs easy. Cfmere, ‰ë“T›P2†.h
hYes, mafam!h
hMaifu mafu amnasmafta, maifu mafu amnasmafta!
 Cfmon, nipples!!h
hShe sounds like such a fuckinf fake.h
(Spin spin spin)
hThere you go.
 Howfs that?h
hHrm, I prefer the areola a little smaller, but I guess
 theyfre fine.h
hHow mysterious.
 *Poke* *poke* *poke*.h
hWefre continuing where we left off again tonight,
 Athena!
 I canft take it anymore! Ifm gonna explode!h
hKyan!
 Youfre so pervertistic!h
hHuh? What happened to ‰ë“T›P2†?h
hShefs at the inn.
 Shefs a good girl who doesnft cause me any trouble.h
hEhhhhhh? Whyyy?
 Why arenft you using heeeer?
 I gave her to you, so use heeer!h
hShut it.
 I can do what I want with her. Shefs mine.
 Youfve got no right to complain.h
hOhh, Mr. Adventurer.
 Howfs my ‰ë“T›P2†? Is she functioning well?
 Shefs strong, right? Hyahyahya!h
hAthenafs the next strongest after Masters, yes!h
hShefs pretty nice.
 I guess shefs good for something a perverted old crone
 like you made.h
hYoufre harsh as always.h
hOoh, ooh, did ya bring me fem?
 Hurry and gimme fem!h
hDonft try to sound all cute, itfs super creepy.
 Not yet. This is such a fucking pain. Canft I just give
 you my nutritious fluid?h
hNo way, if I added stomething like that to her, her
 personality would be ruined!h
hWhat were they again, anyway?h
hWhat, you forgot?
 Theyfre [Angelfs Nectar] and [Devilfs Nectar].h
hOhh, have you obtained my ingredients?
 Well done, well done. I should have known a famous
 weirdo adventurer like you could do it!h
hIfm not weird! Ifm awesome!! Great!!
 Anyway, hurry up and finish ‰ë“T›P2†.h
hOhh, thatfs right! Now, to the 200-year-old base, Ifll
 add three drops of Angelfs Nectar and two of Devilfs
 Nectar......h
hDri`p, drop, drop, dr-drooop!!
 Yahoo, yahoo, YAHOO!!h
hThe cronefs finally lost it.h
hArgh, Ifm just excited, okay!?

hKieeeei, ‰ë“T›P2†, emerge!h
Rattle... Rattle.. Ra..ttle..

 Mmmmmmm, how refreshing!
 I feel so good right now!h
hOhhh, finally...!
 Ifve finally done it, aaaahhhhaaaah!
 Itfs the birth of the Excellent Doll, [‰ë“T›P2†]!h
hHm, shefs a pretty beautiful girl.
 But does she really have all the functions you said she
 did, hag?h
hOh, right.
 Well, why donft you give her a test?
 Hey, little lady.h
hEh? Me?h
hYeah, go ahead and ask [‰ë“T›P2†] some questions with
 truth and lies mixed together.h
hHmm.. Okay...
 Then Athena-san, are cows blue?h
hYep!
 Cows are a refreshing blue, just like your heart!h
hThen, do lost kittens become lions?h
hAf course!
 They become beautiful, fearless lions, just like you!h
hUmmm, are you a cute girl, Athena-san?h
hNope, nope, nope.
 But a bajillion goddesses couldnft compare to you!h
hWaaah, Frostvine-san!
 Can I please stop now? This is kind of embarrassing!h
hNice comebacks! Good job, ‰ë“T›P2†!
 Youfre perfect!
 Ifm afraid of my own talent!h
hIsnft she just lying though?
 Either that or shefs just a brown-noser.h
hYeah, yeah!h
hThatfs ridiculous!!
 You wonft be able to think that for long!h
hYoufll understand how great she is the more you use
 ‰ë“T›P2†.
 Now go ahead and take this prototype.h
hMake sure you pay attention to her.h
hIfve gotta get started on planning the next model.
 Hurry up and get outta here.h
hIfd leave even if you didnft tell me to.
 Hmph, letfs go, Sill, ‰ë“T›P2†.h
hOh.. yes.h
hYessir sir!
 Athena would go to the depths of hell if you told her
 to, woof woof, doggy woof!h
hTake care!
 Make sure ya donft get killed in yer sleep by this
 ‰ë“T›P2† thingy!h
hTamaaaa!!h (Thwack)
hThen Ifll send ‰ë“T›P2† to the inn youfre staying at.
 Youfd better use her.h
hYeah, yeah, Ifm so excited!h
Itfs a mysterious slate with a single button on it.
hAlright, Ifm gonna push it.
 *Push*.h
hRance-sama, therefs something there!h
hYeah, I know.h
We hid and peeked in.
hRance-sama, itfs an Okayu Fever and a Magician.
 That Okayu Fever must be the demon demanding sacrifices
 from the townspeople.h
h....Yeah, must be.
 Hefs fuckinf full of himself for a monster.
 That girl.. is she a Magician..??h
hYes, a Magician, the Gal Monster.
 Theyfre pretty strong.h
hThe Okayu Fever aside, a Magician could be bad news.h
hI donft think itfs the sort of monster wefd have to
 fight right in the beginning of the game if wefre
 talking balance, but...h
hShh, theyfre talking about something.h
 The Okayu Fever and Magician started talking about
 something, so I pricked up my ears.
Okayu h......Upo.h
Magician hCome on.. letfs do it...h
Okayu hUpo??h
Magician hMake me cum with those lovely hands of yours
          again today!!
          Come onnn!h
Okayu h..Cfmere.. upo.h
Magician hAha.. I love you!!h
The Okayu Fever embraced the Magician with his enormous
hands.
....Ack..!
Magician hAhn.. aah.. ahan.. Youfre so good at this.
          Youfre the best.. More.. Give me more..
          Ahn... ahn!h
Okayu hUpo, upo, upo, upo.h
The Magician is being toyed with by the Okayu Feverfs
giant hands.
Sweet moans come from the Magician as shefs groped by the
Okayu Feverfs hands.
Magician h..Ahn.. ahn.. mooore.. *Gasp*.. ah..!h
Ifm so jealous.. Hefs just a stupid Okayu!!
h...You Okayu bastard, if you wanna do dirty shit, do it
 with a female of your own species!!h
hRance-sama, there arenft any female Okayu Fevers.
 Theyfre Guy Monsters.h
hHm..? Guy Monsters??
 Are there only guys then??h
hYes. Things like Ham Bambaras and Dekants are Guy
 Monsters too.h
hHow do they breed if theyfre just guys?h
hThey mate with Gal Monsters.h
hThen what...
 Since this Okayu Fever and this Magician are doing dirty
 stuff right now..h
hIf the Magician gets pregnant.. theyfll have a kid?h
hYes, Rance-sama..
 Did you not know?h
hWhat? I know at least that much, dumbass.h
I bluffed to Sill that I knew, but..
I didnft know.
I see.. I guess that makes sense.
Ifve never seen a male KyanKyan or a female Dekant.
I guess the world is put together pretty conveniently.
But.. While I was being impressed, the Okayu Fever and
Magician were continuing their weird-ass sex.
Okayu hUpoooooo....!!h
Magician hAaaaaaaaaah...!h
Seems like the two of fem just came.
Magician hThat was great.. Youfre amazing.h
Okayu hUpo.. That was good, upo..
       Upopoo..!h
Magician hHey... Itfs gonna be soon, right?h
Okayu hItfs gonna be soon, upo.h
Okayu hSoon, the humans will bring me their next
       sacrifice.
       A cute girl.. Ifm excited, upo.h
....Looks like theyfre talking about Mai.
Magician hBut.. why do you need a human girl when you
          have me as your girlfriend?h
Okayu hUpo.. Theyfre Atlanta-samafs orders.h
Okayu hI have to train them into lewd girls and give them
       to Atlanta-sama, upo.h
Magician hHmmm..? Is that true..?
          But.. Ifm the one you love, right?h
Okayu hUpo.. I love you, upo.h
...Hmm, whofs this Atlanta person..? Whatfs going on..?
Well, whatever.
In any case, if I kill this Okayu Fever, I can have sexy
times with that Mai girl, and thatfs whatfs really
important.
hLetfs go, Sill.
 Wefre gonna kill that Okayu bastard.h
hYes, Rance-sama.h
Sill and I jumped out in front of the Okayu Fever.
Okayu hUpo??
       Who are you.. upo??h
When I actually jumped out in front of him, I realized...
This idiotfs actually pretty big!!
Magician hWhat the hell.. are these humans..?h
Magician hNo way.. Were you watching us this whole time?h
Okayu hUpo.. Humans.. Oh, itfs kind of early, but have
       you brought the sacrifice..? Upo.. Good job.h
Okayu hSo that pink-haired girl is the sacrifice, huh..?
       Shefs cute, upo.
       I wanna touch her, upo.h
hDonft misunderstand, you fucktard!h
Okayu hUpo?h
hIfm here to exterminate you!
 Now accept your fate and die for me!h
Okayu hNo, upo.h
hYou did bad shit, so you die.
 Those are the rules.h
Okayu h..No, no.. Upo!h
hEven if you donft want to, youfre gonna have to die.
 If I kill you.. then I can be happy!!h
Okayu hUpo.. Help meee.. upo!h
Magician hHey, what are you going to do to my precious
          boyfriend?h
hYou know what Ifm gonna do. Ifm gonna kill him.h
Magician hOh, really? Then Ifll be your opponent!
          Ifm going to protect him!h
hHmph, Ifll take care of both of you at the same time!
 Letfs go, Sill.h
hYes, Rance-sama.h
Okayu hUpo.. upo.. upo....h
hOhh..? Youfre pretty tough.
 Youfre still alive?h
Okayu hHelp me, upo?h
hNope. If I donft kill you, I canft have sex with
 Mai-chan, so.h
Okayu hEee.. upo!h
(Stab stab stab stab stab)
  (Stab stab thud)
Okayu hUppooooo(death)!h
I defeated the Okayu Fever.
Found Okayu Key.
hAnd so the evil Okayu Fever perished.
 Now the townspeople wonft have to live in fear of this
 sacrifice stuff.h
hYoufre right, Rance-sama.
 Congratulations.h
hThen why donft I go get my Mai-chan reward?
 Gahahahahahahaha!h

hI canft believe this piece of junk refuses to cooperate
 even after I came all the way here.h
hFour keys..
 This is so much trouble.
 Really, so much trouble.h
hBitch-sama, the Toushin Toshifs detection system has
 found some intruders.h
hWhat? Who is it??h
hWell.. I donft know them.
 Ifll display the footage though.h
Merim fiddled with the equipment and Rance and Sillfs
battle with Okayu was displayed on the screen.
hHrm.. Looks like adventurers.
 They look like theyfre not much compared to us, of
 course.h
hYou think so? I think that man looks pretty capable.
 At least.. moreso than you.h
hWha.. ‹x”Œ“Á!!
 How could you be so disrespectful to your commander!?h
hWhat?
 You wanna go?h
hKuh.. When we get back, itfs a court-martial for you!
 Remember that!h
hOh, those two.. They turned into 50 people.
 A huge army, and.. aah, theyfre coming to attack us!h
hWHAT!? ..50 people.. coming to attack us!!?
 What are you doing!? We have to run!h
hPlease donft lose your composure like that, Captain
 Bitch.
 It was a lie.h
hA lie??h
hYep, just a playful lie.
 You should calm down a little, Captain Bitch.h
hHah hah hah, Ifd expect such shameful behavior from
 you.h
h*Pant* *pant* *pant*.. shut up!
 Who exactly do you think I am..? Kuh!h
hWell.. More importantly, about what wefll do now..
 Will we go looking for these four keys..?h
h........h
hAh, right.h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!
 Ifve got a great idea!h
hI knew I could do it!
 Listen up, you four, Ifm about to give you your orders.h
hˆÉ‰œ.h
hYeah? What is it?h
hJoin up with those two adventurers.
 Control that man with your hypnotism and find those four
 keys.h
h.......h
hThe rest of you will guard me.
 Got it?h
h...Such underhanded methods again...?h
hDid you say something, ‹x”Œ“Á?h
hNah, not really...h
hVery well. Then, ˆÉ‰œ.
 Go.h
Itfs the cell Okayu was keeping Purple in.
Therefs no one in it now....
Theyfre the bars of the cell.
hRance-sama, therefs a girl in that cell!h
hWhaaat!?h
Prisoner h...Who are you??h
hIfm Rance.
 Ifm a man of justice and courage.h
Prisoner hA.. are you...h
Prisoner hHere to save me?h
hIfm a man of justice, so Ifll save you under certain
 conditions.h
Prisoner hPhew.. Finally, Ifm saved.
          Ifm about to go crazy from that Okayu Fever
          touching me day after day.h
hAn Okayu Fever? So then, are you..?h
Prisoner hMy name is Purple Soul.
          Three years ago... *Sigh*, itfs already been
          three years, huh....?h
hWhat happened three years ago?h
Purple hThree years ago, I was offered to the Okayu Fever
        as a sacrifice.h
Purple hThat Okayu Fever keeps touching me day after day
        after day!
        I hate it! So please get me out of here!h
hHmmm? Will you let me do you if I help you?h
Purple hOf course!
        In fact, I was going to ask you the same thing!h
hOhh?h
Purple hI mean, all the Okayu Fever does is touch me! He
        never puts it in at all!
        Ifm going crazy here!h
Purple hThree years! Three years, and all hefs done is
        touch me!h
Purple hCan you understand how painful this is?
        Every time, Ifm right about to cum, and he never
        finishes it!h
hOkay, okay, I got it.
 Ifll fuck you 100 or 200 times.h
Purple hPlease hurry and save me!h
Okay, Ifm opening the cell.
(Clank clank)
I opened the cell with the Okayu Key.
hAlright, I saved you.
 Letfs get right to.. uwah!h
Purple hKya.. Ifm out of the cell!
        Ifm out, Ifm out, Ifm so happyyyy!h
When I opened the door, the girl pushed me aside and ran
off.
Purple hMove! Youfre in my way!h
(Thud)
hShit! What a bitch!
 She said shefd let me fuck fer!!h
hGet back here, you fuckinf tease!!h
I chased after her, but I couldnft find her.
hShit!h
hItfs too bad, isnft it, Rance-sama?h
hWhatfs with that tone, Sill?
 Are you actually happy about this?h
hN.. no.h
hShut up!
 Itfs all your fault!h
(Thwack thwack thwack)
h*Sob* *sob*.h
(Clank clank)
The door is locked (with the Okayu Key) and cannot be
opened.
(Â“º—éèe) is written in small letters on the
pedestal.
hRance-sama, something may happen if we leave the (Bronze
 Bell) here.h
Leave the Â“º—éèe?
h...Alright, why not?
 Ifll give you permission, so do it.h
Sill pulled the Â“º—éèe out of her item bag and left
it on the pedestal.
The (Â“º—éèe) is sitting on the pedestal.
hIfll hold onto the Â“º—éèe again, okay, Rance-sama?h
hHm..? Somethingfs there.h
hYes, itfs a Â“º—éèe.
 Ifll put it into our items.h
hAlright, donft lose it.h
hYes.h
Obtained (Â“º—éèe).
Therefs a pedestal.
(‹óã£q) is written in small letters on the pedestal.
hRance-sama, should I leave the ‹óã£q we picked up on
 the pedestal?h
Leave the ‹óã£q?
hYeah, go ahead.h
Sill pulled the ‹óã£q out of her item bag and left it
on the pedestal.
hIfll hold onto the ‹óã£q again, okay, Rance-sama?h
hTh.. this is...h
hItfs just a normal empty can.h
I picked up the ‹óã£q, shook it, and looked inside,
but unfortunately, it was still empty.
hTch, itfs just junk.
 Youfre supposed to throw this shit away when youfre done
 drinking it.h
hThrow this thing away, Sill.h
hBut Rance-sama.. this ‹óã£q has fImportant Empty
 Canf written on it.h
