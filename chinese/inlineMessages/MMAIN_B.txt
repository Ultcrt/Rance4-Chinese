Unfortunately, I couldnÅft find any monsters.

The door wonÅft open.
The door wonÅft open.
The door wonÅft open.
The door wonÅft open.
Hm, the door appears to be locked and didnÅft open at all.
ÅhTch, what a ridiculous door.Åh
Door-kun ÅhI wonÅft open for you.Åh
The door gave me lip.
Door-kun ÅhI never open unless a girl I like turns my
          knob.Åh
Well, it looks like IÅfve gotta get someone to try to open
this ridiculous door.
Who should I ask?
ÅhYes, Rance-sama.Åh
Sill turned the knob.
Åh....Sure.Åh
Merim turned the knob.
ÅhHohohohohohoho, leave it to me.Åh
Io turned the knob.
ÅhThen IÅfll give it a shot.Åh
Kanami turned the knob.
ÅhIÅfll try.Åh
Maria turned the knob.
Door-kun ÅhMm, wonderful, that feels great!
          IÅfll open, okay?Åh
(Ka-clunk)
The door opened.
ÅhPhew, IÅfm glad that worked.Åh
ÅhJuliaÅfll do her best!Åh
Julia turned the knob.
ÅhI donÅft think itÅfll work, but....Åh
Leila turned the knob.
ÅhGeeently.Åh
Shizuka turned the knob.
ÅhTurn, turn, turny-tuuurn!Åh
Athena 2.0 turned the knob.
Door-kun ÅhMmmm, good.
          I love that dim-wittedness.Åh
Seems like the door opened.
ÅhHunh?? Hunh??Åh
Door-kun ÅhHm.... Hmmmmm....
          SheÅfs nice, but sheÅfs not really my type.Åh
ÅhThereÅfs a transport device, Rance-sama.
 Should we use it?Åh
ÅhLetÅfs see??Åh
"Where are we going, Rance-sama?"
ÅhWeÅfre goinÅf to the Control Room where Bitch or whatever
 is. You know that.Åh
ÅhBut then, we shouldnÅft use this...Åh
ÅhI know that.
 I was joking. Hmph.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, the Landing Crafts are in the Tousho Core.
 Not here.Åh
ÅhRight, weÅfve gotta hurry!!Åh
ÅhAlright, letÅfs go!Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
We stood in the center of the magic circle on the ground.
ÅhRance-sama, thereÅfs something gigantic blocking the
 passageway.Åh
ÅhWhat the heck is it?Åh
ÅhIt looks like a monster. We probably shouldnÅft get too
 close.Åh
....IÅfve got a bad feeling about this.
ÅfAlright, weÅfre turning back.Åh
We returned back the way we came.
Åh*Squeak*....Åh
The Pervert Mouse appeared from around the corner.
ÅhItÅfs been a while, mister.
 Heheheheheh.Åh
The Pervert Mouse approached me, rubbing his paws
together with a servile look on his face.
ÅhRance-sama, do you think he took..
 another weird picture?Åh
ÅhI see, you did it again, eh?Åh
ÅhYep, heheheheheheh.
 So, well..
 I was thinking youÅfd like to buy it again, mister, yep.Åh
ÅhIt better not be another picture of Sill.Åh
I gave him a glare saying Åfnext time you sneak a picture
of Sill, IÅfll kill youÅf while I spoke.
ÅhItÅfs not. I make it a rule to only take one picture per
 subject, so itÅfs a different person this time.Åh
ÅhOh? Who is it?Åh
ÅhThat would ruin the fun of buying it.
 Well then, IÅfll see you here again tomorrow...Åh
ÅhI got it. Just make it cheap this time.
 Understand?Åh
ÅhIÅfll take it into consideration.
 See you.Åh
The Pervert Mouse disappeared swiftly from our sight.
Hmm, I wonder whose picture it is?
If it isnÅft Sill, it could be Kanami, or Maria, or maybe
itÅfs Leila-san, fufufufufufu..!
ÅhRance-sama, shouldnÅft we exterminate a bad mouse like
 that?Åh
ÅhYeah, I sÅfpose we should, after weÅfve gotten all we can
 out of him.
 Fufufufufufufu..!Åh
Åh*Squeak*!Åh
The Pervert Mouse appeared, smiling happily.
ÅhIÅfve prepared your perverted peeping picture, mister.
 Shall we get on with the trade?Åh
ÅhVery well. How much?Åh
ÅhIÅfve lowered the price a bit to.. 
 gold.Åh
Åh
 gold, huh...?Åh
Hmm, what should I do?
ÅhVery well, IÅfll buy it.Åh
ÅhThanks for the business.Åh
I bought the dirty picture for 
 gold.
ÅhWell then, with that....
 Please buy my next work too.Åh
The Pervert Mouse disappeared into thin air.
ÅhDiiie...!!Åh
Åh*Squeak*... youÅfre too cruel..!Åh
(Stab)
I cut the Pervert Mouse down in one strike.
ÅhRance-sama!Åh
ÅhYup, the evil has perished.
 So IÅfll be confiscating that picture.Åh
I took the picture from the Pervert MouseÅfs remains.
ÅhDonÅft want it.Åh
ÅhHeh, you donÅft?
 Reeeally??Åh
ÅhYep, wasting money is the enemy of your wallet.
 I only spend money on significant things.Åh
Åh.......This is significant.. *squeak*.Åh
ÅhAnyway, get lost.
 I donÅft wanna see your face anymore.Åh
Åh*Squeak* *squeak*...Åh
The Pervert Mouse hung his head and disappeared with the
scent of sorrow wafting from its back.
ÅhThis is...??
 Panties??Åh
ÅhLooks like.
 Her face isnÅft in the picture, so we donÅft know who it
 is.Åh
ÅhThis is.. pretty good, I guess.
 ItÅfs pretty arousing.Åh
Åh.......Åh
ÅhOh, this is Julia.. how embarassing!Åh
ÅhI see, so itÅfs a picture of Julia.
 Hmmm, no wonder I thought it looked childish.Åh
ÅhWomen have gotta have a certain shape and sexiness.Åh
ÅhBoooooo, when I grow up IÅfll be super sexy!Åh
ÅhThese unsexy legs have gotta be JuliaÅfs.Åh
ÅhYou can tell, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhOf course I can. IÅfm an expert on womenÅfs bodies, you
 know.Åh
ÅhI memorize a womanÅfs body when I fuck her.
 I know every nook and cranny of your body, you know.
 IÅfve memorized your sensitive spots.Åh
Åh.....Eh..?Åh
ÅhRance-sama, thereÅfs a sign?
 Sould we read it?Åh
