Unfortunately, I couldnft find any monsters.
Unfortunately, I couldnft find any monsters.
The door wonft open.
The door wonft open.
The door wonft open.
The door wonft open.
Hm, the door appears to be locked and didnft open at all.
hTch, what a ridiculous door.h
Door-kun hI wonft open for you.h
The door gave me lip.
Door-kun hI never open unless a girl I like turns my
          knob.h
Well, it looks like Ifve gotta get someone to try to open
this ridiculous door.
Who should I ask?
hYes, Rance-sama.h
Sill turned the knob.
h....Sure.h
”~ä»›G turned the knob.
hHohohohohohoho, leave it to me.h
ˆÉ‰œ turned the knob.
hThen Ifll give it a shot.h
‰Á“Ş”ü turned the knob.
hIfll try.h
àó—˜ˆŸ turned the knob.
Door-kun hMm, wonderful, that feels great!
          Ifll open, okay?h
(Ka-clunk)
The door opened.
hPhew, Ifm glad that worked.h
héä»‰ëfll do her best!h
éä»‰ë turned the knob.
hI donft think itfll work, but....h
åQf turned the knob.
hGeeently.h
u—¥ turned the knob.
hTurn, turn, turny-tuuurn!h
‰ë“T›P2† turned the knob.
Door-kun hMmmm, good.
          I love that dim-wittedness.h
Seems like the door opened.
hHunh?? Hunh??h
Door-kun hHm.... Hmmmmm....
          Shefs nice, but shefs not really my type.h
hTherefs a transport device, Rance-sama.
 Should we use it?h
hLetfs see??h
"Where are we going, Rance-sama?"
hWefre goinf to the Control Room where Bitch or whatever
 is. You know that.h
hBut then, we shouldnft use this...h
hI know that.
 I was joking. Hmph.h
hRance-sama, the Landing Crafts are in the Tousho Core.
 Not here.h
hRight, wefve gotta hurry!!h
hAlright, letfs go!h
hYes.h
We stood in the center of the magic circle on the ground.
hRance-sama, therefs something gigantic blocking the
 passageway.h
hWhat the heck is it?h
hIt looks like a monster. We probably shouldnft get too
 close.h
....Ifve got a bad feeling about this.
fAlright, wefre turning back.h
We returned back the way we came.
h*Squeak*....h
The Pervert Mouse appeared from around the corner.
hItfs been a while, mister.
 Heheheheheh.h
The Pervert Mouse approached me, rubbing his paws
together with a servile look on his face.
hRance-sama, do you think he took..
 another weird picture?h
hI see, you did it again, eh?h
hYep, heheheheheheh.
 So, well..
 I was thinking youfd like to buy it again, mister, yep.h
hIt better not be another picture of Sill.h
I gave him a glare saying fnext time you sneak a picture
of Sill, Ifll kill youf while I spoke.
hItfs not. I make it a rule to only take one picture per
 subject, so itfs a different person this time.h
hOh? Who is it?h
hThat would ruin the fun of buying it.
 Well then, Ifll see you here again tomorrow...h
hI got it. Just make it cheap this time.
 Understand?h
hIfll take it into consideration.
 See you.h
The Pervert Mouse disappeared swiftly from our sight.
Hmm, I wonder whose picture it is?
If it isnft Sill, it could be ‰Á“Ş”ü, or àó—˜ˆŸ, or maybe
itfs åQf-san, fufufufufufu..!
hRance-sama, shouldnft we exterminate a bad mouse like
 that?h
hYeah, I sfpose we should, after wefve gotten all we can
 out of him.
 Fufufufufufufu..!h
h*Squeak*!h
The Pervert Mouse appeared, smiling happily.
hIfve prepared your perverted peeping picture, mister.
 Shall we get on with the trade?h
hVery well. How much?h
hIfve lowered the price a bit to.. 
 gold.h
h
 gold, huh...?h
Hmm, what should I do?
hVery well, Ifll buy it.h
hThanks for the business.h
I bought the dirty picture for 
 gold.
hWell then, with that....
 Please buy my next work too.h
The Pervert Mouse disappeared into thin air.
hDiiie...!!h
h*Squeak*... youfre too cruel..!h
(Stab)
I cut the Pervert Mouse down in one strike.
hRance-sama!h
hYup, the evil has perished.
 So Ifll be confiscating that picture.h
I took the picture from the Pervert Mousefs remains.
hDonft want it.h
hHeh, you donft?
 Reeeally??h
hYep, wasting money is the enemy of your wallet.
 I only spend money on significant things.h
h.......This is significant.. *squeak*.h
hAnyway, get lost.
 I donft wanna see your face anymore.h
h*Squeak* *squeak*...h
The Pervert Mouse hung his head and disappeared with the
scent of sorrow wafting from its back.
hThis is...??
 Panties??h
hLooks like.
 Her face isnft in the picture, so we donft know who it
 is.h
hThis is.. pretty good, I guess.
 Itfs pretty arousing.h
h.......h
hOh, this is éä»‰ë.. how embarassing!h
hI see, so itfs a picture of éä»‰ë.
 Hmmm, no wonder I thought it looked childish.h
hWomen have gotta have a certain shape and sexiness.h
hBoooooo, when I grow up Ifll be super sexy!h
hThese unsexy legs have gotta be éä»‰ëfs.h
hYou can tell, Rance-sama?h
hOf course I can. Ifm an expert on womenfs bodies, you
 know.h
hI memorize a womanfs body when I fuck her.
 I know every nook and cranny of your body, you know.
 Ifve memorized your sensitive spots.h
h.....Eh..?h
hRance-sama, therefs a sign?
 Sould we read it?h
