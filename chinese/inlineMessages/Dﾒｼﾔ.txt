ÅhHello.Åh
Freon ÅhOh, hello, Sill-chan!
       YouÅfre cute today too!Åh
ÅhReally? Thank you very much.Åh
Freon ÅhI was about as cute as you about 30 years ago too,
       you know. I was the talk of the town back then.Åh
ÅhDonÅft tell such obvious lies.Åh
ÅhHello.Åh
Freon ÅhHello, Sill-chan.Åh
ÅhYou havenÅft got any customers as usual, hag.Åh
Freon ÅhI suppose youÅfre right, Rance-kun.
       Want to attract customers for me outside?Åh
ÅhIf I DID attract customers, I bet this place would be
 crawling with beautiful girls!
 Gahahahahahaha!Åh
Freon ÅhWelcome, oh, itÅfs Rance-kun and Sill-chan!Åh
Freon ÅhOh? WhoÅfs that?Åh
ÅhSheÅfs my important lady.
 Be polite to her, okay?Åh
ÅhMy name is Io.Åh
Freon ÅhI donÅft think IÅfve seen you before. Are you from
       the surface?Åh
ÅhNope, I came from the sky.
 Yes, I alighted from the vast sky above us.Åh
Freon ÅhThe sky above this Toushin Toshi?
       So thereÅfs even more above us, huh?Åh
ÅhI lied.
 IÅfm really from the surface.
 How the hell would I come from the sky?Åh
Freon Åh.......Åh
When I entered the diner, Sill greeted me as a waitress.
ÅhWelcome to.. Oh, Rance-sama!Åh
ÅhHmph.Åh
Åh...Are you angry, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhOf course.Åh
ÅhWelcooo.. oh?
 If it isnÅft Rance-chan!Åh
ÅhWhat, are you helping out or something?Åh
ÅhYeah, arenÅft I great?
 JuliaÅfs a popular waitress!Åh
ÅhKyahahahahaha..!
 Oh..!Åh
(Crash)
Julia overturned a tray with a chocolate parfait on it.
ÅhOh no, I did it again!Åh
Freon ÅhAhh, Julia-chan again.
       Just be careful next time.Åh
ÅhYeah.Åh
Freon the hagÅfs around.
SheÅfs not beautiful, so I donÅft really want to look at
her.
ItÅfs a dirty-looking diner.
Looking a place like this over wonÅft do you any good.
Sill is holding a plate and looking up at me.
ItÅfs a face IÅfm tired of seeing, but I guess itÅfs pretty
cute.
SillÅfs wearing the same clothes as the hag Freon.
But itÅfs amazing how different they look.
I suppose itÅfs only natural that my slave looks good in
anything.
*Stare* *stare* *stare*.
ÅhUmm.. Rance-sama.. do you need something??Åh
*Stare* *stare* *stare*.
Åh....Umm...Åh
*Stare* *stare*.
ÅhHmmm.
 Sill.Åh
ÅhYes?Åh
ÅhDo you like that outfit?Åh
ÅhOh.. well.. yes.Åh
ÅhWhich do you like better, the sexy, revealing clothes I
 gave you, or these neat and tidy clothes?Åh
ÅhWell...Åh
ÅhIÅfm asking which you prefer, the sexy clothes I gave you
 or the completely unsexy clothes this auntie gave you.
 Answer.Åh
Åh....Umm.. well, I donÅft really like clothes that are too
 revealing..
 so..
 well...Åh
ÅhSo what, are you saying you like the clothes that hag
 gave you better than the ones I did?Åh
ÅhNo.. thatÅfs not...
 I like the clothes Rance-sama gave me the best.Åh
ÅhRight, good. As you well should.
 IÅfll buy you even sexier clothes next time, so look
 forward to it.Åh
Åh...Ooh.. no waaay.Åh
Freon ÅhThe worldÅfs gotten pretty dangerous.
       IÅfm worried about whatÅfs going to happen next.Åh
ÅhNext, IÅfm going to conquer the world and the Great Rance
 Empire will flourish until the end of time.
 Mmm, what a rosy life IÅfll have.Åh
Freon ÅhRance-kun sure is carefree.. *sigh*.Åh
ÅhWhat was that sigh about!!?Åh
Freon Åh*Sigh*....Åh
Freon ÅhYour friends are all such good kids, Rance-kun.
       IÅfm happy they eat so much of my food.Åh
ÅhJust so you know, IÅfm not payinÅf.
 TheyÅfre all gonna eat free, okay?Åh
Freon ÅhI know.
       I just feel like IÅfve got a bunch of grandchildren
       now and it makes me so happy.Åh
ÅhFreon-chan, I wanna eat
 curry rice
 omelet rice
 tendon
 nubobo fry
 banana miso soup
 today!Åh
Freon ÅhDo you? Well if itÅfs Julia-chanÅfs request, I guess
       IÅfll make that tonight.Åh
ÅhKyahahahaha, yaaay!Åh
Freon ÅhI donÅft have many customers today.
       IÅfm kind of lonely.Åh
ÅhItÅfs Åfcause your place is so lame. There arenÅft many
 people weird enough to want to eat in a place like
 this!Åh
Freon ÅhI suppose youÅfre right. When Sill-chan was working
       here, all of the young men in town ran over
       though.Åh
Freon ÅhI donÅft suppose you could work here again,
       Sill-chan? Just part-time?Åh
ÅhNo thanks.Åh
Freon Åh.......*Sigh*...Åh
ÅhI feel bad for Ms. Freon, Rance-sama.
 CouldnÅft I just help out a little bit..?Åh
ÅhNo way. If youÅfve got time to help out at a place like
 this then rub my shoulders or something.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, please sit here.Åh
ÅhHm, what now??Åh
ÅhWell, this seat is reserved for Rance-sama, so itÅfs the
 one I cleaned the most thoroughly!
 Here, Rance-sama!Åh
ÅhHmph, well whatever.
 Sure, IÅfll sit.Åh
ÅhSill, are you enjoying your work?Åh
ÅhMy waitress work??Åh
ÅhRight.Åh
ÅhYes, itÅfs fun to have different customers come and eat
 happily.Åh
ÅhHmmmmm, I see.Åh
ÅhAlright, then IÅfll let you work at a tea shop where you
 donÅft wear panties and touchingÅfs okay.
 Your payÅfll be high too, so weÅfll make a lot.Åh
Åh.......Åh
ÅhOh donÅft worry, itÅfs not like thereÅfs any sex involved.
 ItÅfs just perverted old grandpas touching you a bit.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, I.. donÅft want to do that kind of work.
 I really, really donÅft.Åh
ÅhDonÅft be so selfish, you damn slave...Åh
Åh...*Sob* *sob*.Åh
Hmph, having fun at this stupid cafe job.
If she doesnÅft calm down a little, IÅfll really make her
do a perverted job.
ÅhUmm.. would you like to order?Åh
ÅhHey Sill, what do you think youÅfre doing..
 asking me if I want to order!!
 Just whose slave do you think you are?Åh
ÅhIÅfm.. well.. Rance-samaÅfs slave.
 But.. right now.. I have to help Ms. Freon out with her
 work...Åh
ÅhShaddup!!Åh
Åh......Åh
I already ate.
IÅfm not gonna do it again.
Freon ÅhWant something to eat?
       IÅfll use all my skills to make you a great meal!Åh
ÅhRance-sama, Ms. FreonÅfs cooking is really good! LetÅfs
 have some!Åh
ÅhAlright, IÅfll eat.
 Bring it out, hag.Åh
Freon ÅhYouÅfre arrogant as always.
       Wait there for a little.Åh
The hag Freon headed to the kitchen.
ÅhIÅfll do my best to get good at cooking too, Rance-sama!Åh
ÅhOf course you will.
 IÅfd never forgive you for serving me bad food.Åh
Freon ÅhItÅfs done!
       My specialty, the Freon Lunch.Åh
A Freon Lunch was placed on the table.
ÅhAlright, IÅfll eat it.Åh
ÅhIt looks really good, Ms. Freon!Åh
(Chomp chomp chomp chomp)
ÅhItÅfs good, isnÅft it, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhItÅfs terrible.Åh
Freon ÅhTerrible? ThatÅfs too bad.
       You donÅft have to finish it then.Åh
Åh...ItÅfs terrible, but IÅfll eat it.
 IÅfm a green kinda guy, so I donÅft waste things.Åh
(Chomp chomp chomp chomp)
ÅhAlright, IÅfll order.Åh
ÅhOkay, Rance-sama.
 HereÅfs the menu.Åh
Sill handed me the menu.
I stared hard at the menu.
ÅhAlright, I want ramen.Åh
ÅhOkay, one ramen.
 Please wait a little.Åh
ÅhIÅfll make a good one for you really quick!Åh
Sill ran into the kitchen in the back.
Wait a little... wait.. wait...
ÅhItÅfs done, Rance-sama!
 Here you go!
 I gave you one more goldfish slice as a special service,
 Rance-sama!Åh
ÅhAlright, it looks pretty good.
 Here I go.Åh
(Munch munch munch munch munch)
(Munch munch munch slurpslurp.)
ÅhPhew.....Åh
ÅhHow was it, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhIÅfd say 50 points.Åh
ÅhAlright, bring me an A Meal.Åh
ÅhYes, right away!Åh
Sill ran to the kitchen.
Wait a bit.. wait.. wait...
ÅhHere it is, Rance-sama!Åh
ÅhHmm, it comes with a lot of stuff.
 Rice, miso soup, mini uppii skewer, pickled taiyaki,
 ohh, and Barnus pudding for dessert!Åh
ÅhAlright, IÅfll eat it.Åh
(Chomp chomp chomp chomp)
ÅhPhew.. IÅfm full.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, how was it?Åh
ÅhIÅfd say about 75 points.Åh
ÅhAlright, gimme some henderopa.Åh
ÅhYes, Rance-samaÅfs favorite, right?
 IÅfll do my best to make it!Åh
Sill headed to the kitchen excitedly.
...Wait a bit...
(*Ka-clank*.. Kyaan, *soob*!)
An alarming sound from the kitchen.. That Sill, she
fucked something up, didnÅft she?
...Wait a bit.
ÅhItÅfs done, Rance-sama!
 IÅfm confident about this one!Åh
A steaming hot henderopa that smelled really good was
placed in front of me.
ÅhHrm, well it looks and smells good.
 But I wonder how... the taste is?Åh
ÅhI think itÅfll be good.Åh
(Chomp)
I.... itÅfs good..!
ÅhHow is it, Rance-sama?Åh
ItÅfs great.. ItÅfs awesome.. but if I say itÅfs great,
SillÅfll get full of herself.
ÅhItÅfs alright.Åh
ÅhI see. I thought it would be pretty good, but...Åh
ÅhWell itÅfs not bad.
 Just work a bit more on it.Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
(Chomp chomp chomp chomp)
ÅhAlright, well then.....Åh
ÅhYes?Åh
ÅhBring me the specialty of the chocolate parfait shop in
 Ice, the chilled curry.Åh
ÅhEhhhh?Åh
ÅhNot Åfehh,Åf chilled curry!
 Hurry up and bring it!Åh
ÅhRance-sama, thatÅfs not on the menu!Åh
ÅhWhat!?
 DonÅft make excuses, make the goddamn food!Åh
ÅhBut we donÅft have the ingredients!Åh
ÅhThen go find them!
 I wanna eat chilled curry!
 Hurry it up! If you donÅft hurry, IÅfll make a scene!Åh
ÅhAhn, Rance-sama, please forgive me!Åh
(Steam steam)
(Steam steam) ÅÉÅ|Lust rising higher and higher.
Man, from up close, waitress clothes are pretty sexy too!
Of course sheÅfs sexy, sheÅfs my woman!
I wanna do it, I wanna do it soon, I wanna do it now!
Rance ÅhDah.....!Åh
I pushed Sill over onto the table.
Sill ÅhKya.. Rance-samaa.. please stop! You canÅft!Åh
Rance ÅhShut up, youÅfre mine!
       IÅfm free to do with you what I please, when I please!Åh
Sill resisted with all her might, but I used both hands to yank her
legs open.
Rance ÅhItÅfs no use!
       Now, letÅfs have some fun!Åh
Sill ÅhRance-sama.. you canÅft!
      Not here..!Åh
Rance ÅhShut up!Åh
(Slap)
She was resisting too much, so I gave Sill a good slap.
Sill Åh.....Åh
Rance ÅhRight, thatÅfs good.. just be obedient.
       Now then, IÅfll get those panties off.Åh
When I reached out to SillÅfs panties...
Freon ÅhHold it, thatÅfs as far as you go.Åh
ÅhTch.Åh
Freon ÅhDonÅft lay a hand on my waitress.Åh
ÅhWhat! Die, you old hag!Åh
I rushed at the hag.
ÅhKuh.. ow..!Åh
Freon ÅhYouÅfre so weak.
       Train some more, kid.Åh
Freon ÅhWell, IÅfm busy, so IÅfll leave the rest to you,
       Sill-chan.Åh
With that, Freon stomped out of the room.
ÅhAre you okay, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhShut it.Åh
ÅhGahahahahahaha, serves you right!
 Do you see how strong I am now?Åh
Freon Åh...Ow.. well, I guess you got me.
       But, Rance.Åh
ÅhWhat, you wanna go again?Åh
Freon ÅhThatÅfs not it.
       I think a little better of you now.Åh
ÅhHm...?Åh
Freon ÅhItÅfs like all of the young folks here have given
       up on living.
       All weÅfve got is weak men.Åh
Freon ÅhBut, it seems.. youÅfre different.
       I feel like youÅfll be able to do something for
       us.Åh
ÅhHmph, I wouldnÅft work for this stupid town.Åh
ÅhMs. Freon...Åh
Freon ÅhSill-chan.
       It was only for a short time, but thanks for all
       your help.
       You donÅft have to help anymore, since I promised.Åh
ÅhGood, I see youÅfre a hag of your word.Åh
ÅhNow, about the promise of free food and lodgings.
 IÅfll have you keep that one too.Åh
Freon ÅhOf course.
       You two can use this place as you like.Åh
Freon ÅhAnd Sill-chan?Åh
ÅhYes?Åh
Freon ÅhI modified your clothes a little to give them a
       power up, so put Åfem on later.Åh
ÅhThank you so much, Ms. Freon!Åh
ÅhHey, hag.
 YouÅfre not gonna power up my armor?Åh
Freon ÅhNope.
       Buy a new one yourself.Åh
ÅhStubborn old hag.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, itÅfs not night yet.
 We should wait until a little later...Åh
Åh....Hmph.Åh
I decided not to sleep, since weÅfve got a little more
time.
ÅhIÅfll destroy this shop so you canÅft get any more
 customers!Åh
I drew my sword and raged around.
ÅhKya.. Rance-sama, please stop!Åh
ÅhNo.. please stop!Åh
ÅhShut up, IÅfm destroying, destroying!Åh
Freon ÅhWhatÅfs all this?Åh
Freon ÅhHmph, itÅfs you.
       What do you think youÅfre doing, making a mess in
       my shop?Åh
ÅhHmph, what do you think?
 ItÅfd be better for the world if this shop didnÅft exist.
 IÅfm destroying it for the sake of justice.Åh
Freon Åh...You just donÅft learn, kid.
       I suppose you wonÅft unless I punish you again.Åh
ÅhShut it, hag!!
 Die!Åh
(Snap snap snap)
ÅhWhat are you doing, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhWhatÅfs it look like IÅfm doing? IÅfm splitting the
 chopsticks.Åh
(Snap snap)
I split the chopsticks apart pair by pair and put them
back in their container.
ÅhRance-sama, itÅfll be trouble for later customers if you
 split all of the chopsticks now.Åh
ÅhI donÅft fuckinÅf care.Åh
ÅhRance-sama...Åh
ÅhOh, Rance-san, itÅfs already late.
 Where are you going?Åh
Åh........Åh
ÅhWhy donÅft we do something fun together?Åh
ÅhSure, I guess.
 WeÅfre done adventuring for the day.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, itÅfs already late.Åh
Åh.....Åh
ÅhItÅfs dangerous to go out when itÅfs dark. Why donÅft we
 stay the night and keep adventuring tomorrow?Åh
ÅhSill, if you want me to fuck you, be honest.
 YouÅfre such a pervert.Åh
ÅhTh.. thatÅfs not what I meant.Åh
ÅhAlright, letÅfs go to the room.Åh
ÅhOh, Rance-sama.. come again.Åh
ÅhHmph.Åh
I kicked the door of the shop violently and left.
ÅhWeÅfre leaving.Åh
ÅhOh, okay.
 See you later, Ms. Freon!Åh
Freon ÅhYeah, come on over again soon, alright?Åh
ThereÅfs no need to organize our party right now.
IÅfm organizing the party.
ÅhRance-sama, we have 
 people in our adventuring team
 right now.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, itÅfll be difficult to move around in the
 dungeons if we add even more people to our party.Åh
ÅhI sÅfpose so. ItÅfll only be annoying if we increase the
 number of burdens.Åh
ÅhWeÅfll have to remove someone from the party if we want
 someone else to join.Åh
"Rance-sama, these people arenÅft currently in our party.
 Who would you like to join?"
Åh...These guysÅfre all crap. We donÅft need any of Åfem.Åh
ÅhAlright, Kentou Kanami.
 YouÅfre joining the party.Åh
ÅhBe grateful, gahahahahahaha!Åh
ÅhIÅfm not particularly happy about this.Åh
Kanami joined the party.
ÅhIo, join the party.Åh
ÅhNo way.
 I hate you Rance, why would I ever want to adventure
 with you?Åh
ÅhW.. what!?Åh
ÅhJust kidding.
 IÅfm actually happy to adventure with you, Rance-san.
 LetÅfs go!Åh
ÅhR.. right.Åh
Io joined the party.
ÅhMerim, join the party.Åh
ÅhIs it alright?Åh
ÅhIt is. Work hard and help me out.Åh
ÅhAre you really alright with someone like me?Åh
ÅhYup.Åh
Merim joined the party.
ÅhRick, join the party.Åh
ÅhThanks, that makes me happy.Åh
Rick joined the party.
ÅhJulia...Åh
ÅhI wanna go, I wanna go, IÅfll do my best!Åh
ÅhI havenÅft said anything yet!?Åh
ÅhYouÅfre gonna add Julia to your party, arenÅft you?
 ItÅfs Åfcause IÅfm such a hard worker! LetÅfs go!Åh
Julia joined the party.
ÅhMaria Custard, youÅfre joining the party.
 IÅfll bring you along for the exploration.Åh
ÅhOkay, IÅfll impress you with my Tulip #1!Åh
Maria joined the party.
ÅhShizuka, join the party and help me out.Åh
Åh...I donÅft want to...
 but I guess I have to.Åh
Masou Shizuka joined the party.
ÅhLeila-san, join the party.Åh
ÅhYes, sir. IÅfll do my best.Åh
Leila joined the party.
ÅhAye-ayen, Master!Åh
Athena 2.0 joined the party.
ÅhRance-sama, whoÅfs leaving the party?Åh
Åh..Hmph, whatever. ItÅfs too much of a bother. LetÅfs just
 go like this.Åh
ÅhMe...Åh
Åh??Åh
ÅhIÅfm gonna take a break here, so you guys just go
 adventure or whatever on your own.Åh
ÅhBut, without Rance-sama...Åh
ÅhOf course.
 Bring back all of the treasure and money you find.Åh
ÅhRance-sama.....Åh
ÅhArgh, donÅft make such a miserable face!
 You really canÅft do anything without me, huh?Åh
ÅhOh well. I guess IÅfve gotta be the leader.Åh
ÅhYes, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhSill, you stay here...Åh
ÅhBut, Rance-sama..!
 I donÅft want to!Åh
ÅhIÅfll do anything, so please bring me with you!
 I want to be with you forever, Rance-sama!Åh
Åh......Åh
ÅhPlease, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhTch, just donÅft get in my way.Åh
ÅhYes!Åh
ÅhKanami, IÅfm leaving you out of the fun.
 Stay here.Åh
ÅhI donÅft particularly care.Åh
Kentou Kanami left the party.
ÅhIo, stay here.Åh
Åh....I got it.Åh
Io Ishtar left the party.
ÅhMerim, watch our stuff while weÅfre gone.Åh
ÅhI suppose itÅfs better to leave someone who isnÅft any use
 in battle like me behind.Åh
Åh......Åh
ÅhItÅfs alright. You donÅft have to feel bad.
 IÅfm a little sad I canÅft go into the dungeon though.Åh
Merim Zahl left the party.
ÅhRick, leave the party and stand by here.Åh
ÅhDarn.Åh
Rick Addison left the party.
ÅhJulia, watch the diner.
 Got it?Åh
ÅhNo, no, I donÅft wanna!Åh
ÅhYouÅfre staying.Åh
ÅhWaah, waah, waah!Åh
Julia Rindam left the party.
ÅhMaria, stay here.Åh
ÅhItÅfs too bad, but I guess I should.
 But put me back in when you get the chance.Åh
ÅhIÅfll think about it.Åh
Maria Custard left the party.
Masou Shizuka left the party.
ÅhLeila, leave the party and stand by here.Åh
ÅhUnderstood.
 IÅfll protect the town.Åh
Leila Glegnee left the party.
ÅhOh my my, oh my my....Åh
Athena 2.0 left the party.
