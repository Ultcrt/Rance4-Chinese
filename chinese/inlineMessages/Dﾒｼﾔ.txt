hHello.h
Freon hOh, hello, Šó˜I-chan!
       Youfre cute today too!h
hReally? Thank you very much.h
Freon hI was about as cute as you about 30 years ago too,
       you know. I was the talk of the town back then.h
hDonft tell such obvious lies.h
hHello.h
Freon hHello, Šó˜I-chan.h
hYou havenft got any customers as usual, hag.h
Freon hI suppose youfre right, —–z-kun.
       Want to attract customers for me outside?h
hIf I DID attract customers, I bet this place would be
 crawling with beautiful girls!
 Gahahahahahaha!h
Freon hWelcome, oh, itfs —–z-kun and Šó˜I-chan!h
Freon hOh? Whofs that?h
hShefs my important lady.
 Be polite to her, okay?h
hMy name is Io.h
Freon hI donft think Ifve seen you before. Are you from
       the surface?h
hNope, I came from the sky.
 Yes, I alighted from the vast sky above us.h
Freon hThe sky above this Toushin Toshi?
       So therefs even more above us, huh?h
hI lied.
 Ifm really from the surface.
 How the hell would I come from the sky?h
Freon h.......h
When I entered the diner, Šó˜I greeted me as a waitress.
hWelcome to.. Oh, —–z-sama!h
hHmph.h
h...Are you angry, —–z-sama?h
hOf course.h
hWelcooo.. oh?
 If it isnft —–z-chan!h
hWhat, are you helping out or something?h
hYeah, arenft I great?
 Juliafs a popular waitress!h
hKyahahahahaha..!
 Oh..!h
(Crash)
Julia overturned a tray with a chocolate parfait on it.
hOh no, I did it again!h
Freon hAhh, Julia-chan again.
       Just be careful next time.h
hYeah.h
Freon the hagfs around.
Shefs not beautiful, so I donft really want to look at
her.
Itfs a dirty-looking diner.
Looking a place like this over wonft do you any good.
Šó˜I is holding a plate and looking up at me.
Itfs a face Ifm tired of seeing, but I guess itfs pretty
cute.
Šó˜Ifs wearing the same clothes as the hag Freon.
But itfs amazing how different they look.
I suppose itfs only natural that my slave looks good in
anything.
*Stare* *stare* *stare*.
hUmm.. —–z-sama.. do you need something??h
*Stare* *stare* *stare*.
h....Umm...h
*Stare* *stare*.
hHmmm.
 Šó˜I.h
hYes?h
hDo you like that outfit?h
hOh.. well.. yes.h
hWhich do you like better, the sexy, revealing clothes I
 gave you, or these neat and tidy clothes?h
hWell...h
hIfm asking which you prefer, the sexy clothes I gave you
 or the completely unsexy clothes this auntie gave you.
 Answer.h
h....Umm.. well, I donft really like clothes that are too
 revealing..
 so..
 well...h
hSo what, are you saying you like the clothes that hag
 gave you better than the ones I did?h
hNo.. thatfs not...
 I like the clothes —–z-sama gave me the best.h
hRight, good. As you well should.
 Ifll buy you even sexier clothes next time, so look
 forward to it.h
h...Ooh.. no waaay.h
Freon hThe worldfs gotten pretty dangerous.
       Ifm worried about whatfs going to happen next.h
hNext, Ifm going to conquer the world and the Great —–z
 Empire will flourish until the end of time.
 Mmm, what a rosy life Ifll have.h
Freon h—–z-kun sure is carefree.. *sigh*.h
hWhat was that sigh about!!?h
Freon h*Sigh*....h
Freon hYour friends are all such good kids, —–z-kun.
       Ifm happy they eat so much of my food.h
hJust so you know, Ifm not payinf.
 Theyfre all gonna eat free, okay?h
Freon hI know.
       I just feel like Ifve got a bunch of grandchildren
       now and it makes me so happy.h
hFreon-chan, I wanna eat
 curry rice
 omelet rice
 tendon
 nubobo fry
 banana miso soup
 today!h
Freon hDo you? Well if itfs Julia-chanfs request, I guess
       Ifll make that tonight.h
hKyahahahaha, yaaay!h
Freon hI donft have many customers today.
       Ifm kind of lonely.h
hItfs fcause your place is so lame. There arenft many
 people weird enough to want to eat in a place like
 this!h
Freon hI suppose youfre right. When Šó˜I-chan was working
       here, all of the young men in town ran over
       though.h
Freon hI donft suppose you could work here again,
       Sill-chan? Just part-time?h
hNo thanks.h
Freon h.......*Sigh*...h
hI feel bad for Ms. Freon, —–z-sama.
 Couldnft I just help out a little bit..?h
hNo way. If youfve got time to help out at a place like
 this then rub my shoulders or something.h
h—–z-sama, please sit here.h
hHm, what now??h
hWell, this seat is reserved for —–z-sama, so itfs the
 one I cleaned the most thoroughly!
 Here, —–z-sama!h
hHmph, well whatever.
 Sure, Ifll sit.h
hSill, are you enjoying your work?h
hMy waitress work??h
hRight.h
hYes, itfs fun to have different customers come and eat
 happily.h
hHmmmmm, I see.h
hAlright, then Ifll let you work at a tea shop where you
 donft wear panties and touchingfs okay.
 Your payfll be high too, so wefll make a lot.h
h.......h
hOh donft worry, itfs not like therefs any sex involved.
 Itfs just perverted old grandpas touching you a bit.h
h—–z-sama, I.. donft want to do that kind of work.
 I really, really donft.h
hDonft be so selfish, you damn slave...h
h...*Sob* *sob*.h
Hmph, having fun at this stupid cafe job.
If she doesnft calm down a little, Ifll really make her
do a perverted job.
hUmm.. would you like to order?h
hHey Sill, what do you think youfre doing..
 asking me if I want to order!!
 Just whose slave do you think you are?h
hIfm.. well.. —–z-samafs slave.
 But.. right now.. I have to help Ms. Freon out with her
 work...h
hShaddup!!h
h......h
I already ate.
Ifm not gonna do it again.
Freon hWant something to eat?
       Ifll use all my skills to make you a great meal!h
h—–z-sama, Ms. Freonfs cooking is really good! Letfs
 have some!h
hAlright, Ifll eat.
 Bring it out, hag.h
Freon hYoufre arrogant as always.
       Wait there for a little.h
The hag Freon headed to the kitchen.
hIfll do my best to get good at cooking too, —–z-sama!h
hOf course you will.
 Ifd never forgive you for serving me bad food.h
Freon hItfs done!
       My specialty, the Freon Lunch.h
A Freon Lunch was placed on the table.
hAlright, Ifll eat it.h
hIt looks really good, Ms. Freon!h
(Chomp chomp chomp chomp)
hItfs good, isnft it, —–z-sama?h
hItfs terrible.h
Freon hTerrible? Thatfs too bad.
       You donft have to finish it then.h
h...Itfs terrible, but Ifll eat it.
 Ifm a green kinda guy, so I donft waste things.h
(Chomp chomp chomp chomp)
hAlright, Ifll order.h
hOkay, —–z-sama.
 Herefs the menu.h
Sill handed me the menu.
I stared hard at the menu.
hAlright, I want ramen.h
hOkay, one ramen.
 Please wait a little.h
hIfll make a good one for you really quick!h
Sill ran into the kitchen in the back.
Wait a little... wait.. wait...
hItfs done, —–z-sama!
 Here you go!
 I gave you one more goldfish slice as a special service,
 —–z-sama!h
hAlright, it looks pretty good.
 Here I go.h
(Munch munch munch munch munch)
(Munch munch munch slurpslurp.)
hPhew.....h
hHow was it, —–z-sama?h
hIfd say 50 points.h
hAlright, bring me an A Meal.h
hYes, right away!h
Sill ran to the kitchen.
Wait a bit.. wait.. wait...
hHere it is, —–z-sama!h
hHmm, it comes with a lot of stuff.
 Rice, miso soup, mini uppii skewer, pickled taiyaki,
 ohh, and Barnus pudding for dessert!h
hAlright, Ifll eat it.h
(Chomp chomp chomp chomp)
hPhew.. Ifm full.h
h—–z-sama, how was it?h
hIfd say about 75 points.h
hAlright, gimme some henderopa.h
hYes, —–z-samafs favorite, right?
 Ifll do my best to make it!h
Sill headed to the kitchen excitedly.
...Wait a bit...
(*Ka-clank*.. Kyaan, *soob*!)
An alarming sound from the kitchen.. That Sill, she
fucked something up, didnft she?
...Wait a bit.
hItfs done, —–z-sama!
 Ifm confident about this one!h
A steaming hot henderopa that smelled really good was
placed in front of me.
hHrm, well it looks and smells good.
 But I wonder how... the taste is?h
hI think itfll be good.h
(Chomp)
I.... itfs good..!
hHow is it, —–z-sama?h
Itfs great.. Itfs awesome.. but if I say itfs great,
Sillfll get full of herself.
hItfs alright.h
hI see. I thought it would be pretty good, but...h
hWell itfs not bad.
 Just work a bit more on it.h
hYes.h
(Chomp chomp chomp chomp)
hAlright, well then.....h
hYes?h
hBring me the specialty of the chocolate parfait shop in
 Ice, the chilled curry.h
hEhhhh?h
hNot fehh,f chilled curry!
 Hurry up and bring it!h
h—–z-sama, thatfs not on the menu!h
hWhat!?
 Donft make excuses, make the goddamn food!h
hBut we donft have the ingredients!h
hThen go find them!
 I wanna eat chilled curry!
 Hurry it up! If you donft hurry, Ifll make a scene!h
hAhn, —–z-sama, please forgive me!h
(Steam steam)
(Steam steam) ƒ|Lust rising higher and higher.
Man, from up close, waitress clothes are pretty sexy too!
Of course shefs sexy, shefs my woman!
I wanna do it, I wanna do it soon, I wanna do it now!
—–z hDah.....!h
I pushed Sill over onto the table.
Sill hKya.. —–z-samaa.. please stop! You canft!h
—–z hShut up, youfre mine!
       Ifm free to do with you what I please, when I please!h
Sill resisted with all her might, but I used both hands to yank her
legs open.
—–z hItfs no use!
       Now, letfs have some fun!h
Sill h—–z-sama.. you canft!
      Not here..!h
—–z hShut up!h
(Slap)
She was resisting too much, so I gave Sill a good slap.
Sill h.....h
—–z hRight, thatfs good.. just be obedient.
       Now then, Ifll get those panties off.h
When I reached out to Sillfs panties...
Freon hHold it, thatfs as far as you go.h
hTch.h
Freon hDonft lay a hand on my waitress.h
hWhat! Die, you old hag!h
I rushed at the hag.
hKuh.. ow..!h
Freon hYoufre so weak.
       Train some more, kid.h
Freon hWell, Ifm busy, so Ifll leave the rest to you,
       Sill-chan.h
With that, Freon stomped out of the room.
hAre you okay, —–z-sama?h
hShut it.h
hGahahahahahaha, serves you right!
 Do you see how strong I am now?h
Freon h...Ow.. well, I guess you got me.
       But, —–z.h
hWhat, you wanna go again?h
Freon hThatfs not it.
       I think a little better of you now.h
hHm...?h
Freon hItfs like all of the young folks here have given
       up on living.
       All wefve got is weak men.h
Freon hBut, it seems.. youfre different.
       I feel like youfll be able to do something for
       us.h
hHmph, I wouldnft work for this stupid town.h
hMs. Freon...h
Freon hSill-chan.
       It was only for a short time, but thanks for all
       your help.
       You donft have to help anymore, since I promised.h
hGood, I see youfre a hag of your word.h
hNow, about the promise of free food and lodgings.
 Ifll have you keep that one too.h
Freon hOf course.
       You two can use this place as you like.h
Freon hAnd Sill-chan?h
hYes?h
Freon hI modified your clothes a little to give them a
       power up, so put fem on later.h
hThank you so much, Ms. Freon!h
hHey, hag.
 Youfre not gonna power up my armor?h
Freon hNope.
       Buy a new one yourself.h
hStubborn old hag.h
h—–z-sama, itfs not night yet.
 We should wait until a little later...h
h....Hmph.h
I decided not to sleep, since wefve got a little more
time.
hIfll destroy this shop so you canft get any more
 customers!h
I drew my sword and raged around.
hKya.. —–z-sama, please stop!h
hNo.. please stop!h
hShut up, Ifm destroying, destroying!h
Freon hWhatfs all this?h
Freon hHmph, itfs you.
       What do you think youfre doing, making a mess in
       my shop?h
hHmph, what do you think?
 Itfd be better for the world if this shop didnft exist.
 Ifm destroying it for the sake of justice.h
Freon h...You just donft learn, kid.
       I suppose you wonft unless I punish you again.h
hShut it, hag!!
 Die!h
(Snap snap snap)
hWhat are you doing, —–z-sama?h
hWhatfs it look like Ifm doing? Ifm splitting the
 chopsticks.h
(Snap snap)
I split the chopsticks apart pair by pair and put them
back in their container.
hRance-sama, itfll be trouble for later customers if you
 split all of the chopsticks now.h
hI donft fuckinf care.h
hRance-sama...h
hOh, Rance-san, itfs already late.
 Where are you going?h
h........h
hWhy donft we do something fun together?h
hSure, I guess.
 Wefre done adventuring for the day.h
hRance-sama, itfs already late.h
h.....h
hItfs dangerous to go out when itfs dark. Why donft we
 stay the night and keep adventuring tomorrow?h
hSill, if you want me to fuck you, be honest.
 Youfre such a pervert.h
hTh.. thatfs not what I meant.h
hAlright, letfs go to the room.h
hOh, Rance-sama.. come again.h
hHmph.h
I kicked the door of the shop violently and left.
hWefre leaving.h
hOh, okay.
 See you later, Ms. Freon!h
Freon hYeah, come on over again soon, alright?h
Therefs no need to organize our party right now.
Ifm organizing the party.
hRance-sama, we have 
 people in our adventuring team
 right now.h
hRance-sama, itfll be difficult to move around in the
 dungeons if we add even more people to our party.h
hI sfpose so. Itfll only be annoying if we increase the
 number of burdens.h
hWefll have to remove someone from the party if we want
 someone else to join.h
"Rance-sama, these people arenft currently in our party.
 Who would you like to join?"
h...These guysfre all crap. We donft need any of fem.h
hAlright, Kentou ‰Á“Ş”ü.
