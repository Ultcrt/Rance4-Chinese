...A monster attacked.
Leave the room?
ItÅfs a bookshelf.
Hmm? ThereÅfs stuff like poetry anthologies.
ÅhRance-sama, I want some poetry anthologies too.Åh
ÅhBoring. Poetry is trash.Åh
Åh........Åh
ItÅfs a bookshelf.
Hmm? I canÅft read these books at all.
ÅhItÅfs a trolley, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhCheck to see if thereÅfs anything valuable in it.Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
(Rustle rustle rustle)
ÅhI donÅft know what any of these balls and tools are for,
 and I donÅft see anything that looks valuable.Åh
ItÅfs a Maus, a kind of Magic Unit.
It looks pretty complete, but I guess it isnÅft yet.
ItÅfd be trouble if it started moving, so IÅfm gonna put
some snot on it.
(Stick)
ÅhRance-sama... what are you...??Åh
ÅhIÅfm putting my holy snot on it!
 Now he canÅft move!
 Gahahahahahaha....!Åh
Åh.......Åh
ÅhWhat a nice chair, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhYeah, but it looks hard.
 ItÅfs got no cushions or anything.Åh
(Bang bang)
I hit the seat of the chair and is made a hard sound.
ÅhI want a fluffy chair that you sink into when you sit on
 it.Åh
ÅhYeah, a chair about as soft as this...Åh
ÅhKyan!Åh
I stroked SillÅfs butt.
ÅhOh, Rance-sama....Åh
Just a normal chair.
DoesnÅft look like thereÅfs anything strange about it.
ItÅfs a Magic Unit, a Maus.
Looks like it was in the middle of being made and isnÅft
complete yet.
Hanny ÅhWelcome, sir!Åh
Hanny ÅhPlease buy something, sir!Åh
Hanny ÅhNo one comes to shop in a place like this, sir.
       But it doesnÅft cost anything to set up here.Åh
Hanny ÅhWhat would you like, sir?Åh
Hanny ÅhOne 
, yes?
       ThatÅfll be 
 gold.Åh
Hanny Åh*Sob*, couldnÅft sell again today, huh?Åh
Hanny Åh*Sob*, you donÅft have enough money, sir.Åh
Hanny ÅhThank you, sir.Åh
I bought the 
.
ÅhWhat the heckÅfs this?Åh
ÅhItÅfs an army of Mause, Rance-sama!
 ItÅfd be bad if they all attacked us!Åh
ÅhWell, it looks like theyÅfre all dead or hibernating
 anyway.Åh
ÅhMerim, dÅfyou know what this is?Åh
ÅhThis looks like a hangar for the Magic Units that
 supported the Toushin ToshiÅfs primary weapons, the
 Tousho.Åh
ÅhThese look like Mause, one of the later varieties.Åh
ÅhMause, eh?Åh
ÅhThere are a bunch of other kinds of Magic Units, like
 the Elefant, Nashorn, and Dora, but I donÅft see any of
 them here.Åh
ÅhTheir features are..Åh
ÅhThatÅfs enough.Åh
I canÅft listen to everything Merim says or sheÅfll go on
forever.
ThereÅfs a small donation box.
ÅhSill, there might be change in here.
 Get the money out.Åh
ÅhWeÅfll be punished, Rance-sama.
 These are a godÅfs offerings.Åh
ÅhI donÅft care. IÅfm a god.
 If theyÅfre for a god, theyÅfre for me.Åh
ÅhOkay.Åh
Sill stuck her hand in the donation box and fished around
inside.
ÅhWell? Find anything?Åh
Åh........Åh
ÅhI think itÅfs empty. I canÅft find anything.Åh
ÅhShit, how disappointing.Åh
ÅhIÅfm gonna destroy iiiit!!Åh
(Thwack thwack thwack)
(Whack whack whack)
I punched and kicked the donation box as hard as I could,
but I didnÅft put so much as a scratch on it.
ÅhItÅfs a sturdy donation box, isnÅft it, Rance-sama?Åh
(Whack)
ÅhOwwww!Åh
ÅhRance-sama, it says that if you put 1,000 gold in the
 donation box, the southern door will open.
 Do you want to put more in?Åh
ÅhWhoÅfd put more money in, you dumbass?Åh
ÅhI suppose youÅfre right.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, thereÅfs something written on the donation
 box.
 IÅfll read it.Åh
ÅhMm.Åh
ÅhLetÅfs see... ÅfIf you put 1,000 gold into this donation
 box, the southern door will open.Åf is what it says.Åh
ÅhWhatÅfs that mean?Åh
ÅhI donÅft really know, but I guess putting 1,000 gold in
 will open a door.
 Should we put something in it?Åh
(Clank clank)
I put 1,000 gold in the donation box.
Åh...I feel like this is kind of a waste, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhYouÅfre gonna make up this money later.Åh
Åh...Eh?Åh
ÅhIÅfm gonna put half in. 500 gold.
 There.Åh
(Clank clank)
I put 500 gold in the donation box.
ÅhRance-sama, half might not work.Åh
(Clink)
I put the huge amount of 1 gold in the donation box.
ÅhI put in 1 gold. Something goodÅfs bound to happen.Åh
ÅhHopefully.Åh
(Spit spit)
I spit in the donation box.
ÅhThatÅfs gross, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhWhat? You think my holy salivaÅfs ÅfgrossÅf?Åh
I grabbed Sill and gave her a really a really hot, wet
kiss.
ÅhAh..!Åh
I twine my tongue around hers and make sure a bunch of my
spit gets in her mouth.
ÅhPhew, dÅfyou still think my salivaÅfs gross?Åh
Åh....No.Åh
ÅhCould you not?Åh
ÅhWhat, you want a kiss from me too, Kanami?Åh
ÅhNo thanks.Åh
Putting my money in a donation box is beyond stupid.
I canÅft do it.
ÅhRance-sama, we donÅft have enough.Åh
ÅF  Deadly Poison Jar              ÅF
ÅFThe poison in this jar will kill ÅF
ÅFanyone who so much as touches it.ÅF
ÅFDo not put your hand in.         ÅF
ThereÅfs a large jar packed with a creepy green liquid.
ThereÅfs probably nothing else in it.
ÅhIt looks like a jar of poison, Rance-sama.
 ItÅfs dangerous, so letÅfs not touch it.Åh
ÅhYeah, itÅfs kind of an acidic color, so itÅfs almost
 definitely poison.Åh
ÅhBut if you were really desperate to hide something,
 donÅft you think this would be perfect?Åh
Well, what should we do?
ÅhThere must be something in there.
 SomebodyÅfs gonna have to stick a hand in.Åh
ÅhSill, put your hand in.Åh
ÅhBut itÅfs poison!
 Please donÅft make me!Åh
ÅhNope.
 Do it.Åh
Åh.........Åh
Sill slowly, fearfully stuck her hand in the jar.
ÅhKya!!!!!Åh
Sill took damage from the poison and was reduced to 1 HP.
ÅhRance-sama, my hand hurts.
 *Sob* *sob*.Åh
ÅhDonÅft cry, you were just unlucky.Åh
ÅhKanami, stick your hand in the jar and see if thereÅfs
 anything in there.Åh
ÅhNo, donÅft be ridiculous.
 Why donÅft you do it?Åh
ÅhBut itÅfd be terrible if I got hurt.Åh
ÅhWh- then you donÅft care what happens to me!!?Åh
ÅhYep, so hurry it up.Åh
I grabbed KanamiÅfs arm and forced her hand into the jar.
ÅhKya.. Ow!!Åh
Kanami took damage from the poison and was reduced to 1
HP.
ÅhLooks like it was poison after all.Åh
ÅhYou brute!!Åh
ÅhMaria, put your hand in this jar and check it out.Åh
ÅhI donÅft have to put my hand in to check it out.Åh
Maria took a small square of paper out of her pocket and
held it up.
ÅhItÅfs litmus paper!Åh
ÅhUh huh. WhatÅfs that?Åh
ÅhThis is paper that analyzes a liquidÅfs composition.
 You just put some of the liquid on it like this..Åh
Maria dipped the weird paper in the liquid and showed it
to me.
ÅhSee? It says ÅfpoisonÅf right here.Åh
I certainly could see the word ÅfpoisonÅf appearing faintly
on the paper.
ÅhSee? IsnÅft litmus paper handy?Åh
ÅhI see, so itÅfs poison....Åh
ÅhYeah, letÅfs leave the dangerous shit to Feliss.Åh
ÅhFeliss, get out here.Åh
(Poof)
Feliss appeared from the Devil Realm.
ÅhWhat do you need, Master..?
 Hmmm, IÅfve got a bad feeling about this.Åh
ÅhStick your hand in this jar and see if thereÅfs anything
 inside it.Åh
ÅhThis jar....? Ugh!Åh
ÅhItÅfs a jar of poison!
 No way, I donÅft want to!Åh
ÅhHm? You canÅft obey the words of your master?Åh
Åh....F-fine.
 IÅfll do it, okay? Happy now?Åh
Feliss timidly stuck her hand into the jar.
Åh*Gasp*... ow.. ow.. argh!Åh
ÅhWell? Is there something in there?Åh
ÅhWait.. whatÅfs.. there!Åh
Feliss brought her hand, burned and releasing some kind
of white smoke, out of the jar along with a shiny thing.
ÅhDevils can feel pain too, you know.
 Please donÅft give me such unreasonable orders.Åh
ÅhGahahahahaha, good work.
 Anyway, hand it over.Åh
I took the ruby from Feliss.
ÅhIÅfm going home then.Åh
(Poof)
Feliss returned to the Devil Realm.
ÅhSill, look more closely at the jar.
 There might be some kind of trick to it.Åh
ÅhYes, okay.Åh
Sill started nervously investigating the jar.
ÅhWell? Figured anything out?Åh
ÅhIt doesnÅft look like thereÅfs any magic on it, and
 nothing seems particularly suspicious about it.Åh
For some reason, a girl is sitting at a tea table.
Chao ÅhHello, travelers.
      My name is Chao.Åh
Chao ÅhThereÅfs no need to stand over there. Why not have
      tea with me?Åh
ÅhOkay, sure.Åh
I sat down across from Chao.
When I sat down, Chao started crying.
ÅhHey, wait a second, why are you crying?
 I havenÅft even done anything!Åh
Chao ÅhIÅfm sorry, IÅfm just.. so sad.Åh
ÅhWhat are you sad about?
 Just tell me about it. IÅfll listen.Åh
Chao ÅhThank you so much, Rance-san.
      But please have some delicious tea first.Åh
Chao offered me some tea.
Åh....How do you know my name?
 I havenÅft said it yet.Åh
Chao took a sip of tea before answering my question.
Chao ÅhThatÅfs just common knowledge.
      Everyone knows about Rance-san, the strongest
      adventurer of the century.Åh
Chao ÅhI hear heÅfs strong, smart, overflowing with a sense
      of justice, and an overall wonderful person.Åh
ÅhYup, seems like youÅfve just perfectly described me!Åh
(Sssiiip)
ÅhThis is pretty good tea.
 Are you using some kinda famous tea leaves?Åh
Chao ÅhNo, itÅfs just third-rate tea they sell in stores.Åh
Åh........Åh
Chao ÅhBy the way, Rance-san.
      I have a favor IÅfd like to ask of you.. May I?Åh
ÅhIÅfve never turned down a beautiful womanÅfs request.Åh
Chao ÅhJust what I would expect from Rance-san.Åh
ÅhGahahahahahahahaha!Åh
Chao ÅhIÅfd like you to exterminate the witch, Atlanta, who
      lives in this dungeon.Åh
ÅhAtlanta the witch??Åh
Chao ÅhYes, sheÅfs an evil witch who serves a Dark Lord.Åh
Chao ÅhItÅfs said that she traps people in mirrors.Åh
Chao took another sip of tea there.
ÅhSo thatÅfs the reason youÅfre sad.
 A lover or relative of yours got stuck in one of
 AtlantaÅfs mirrors, right?Åh
Chao Åh...IÅfll go with that.Åh
Åh???Åh
ÅhWell, whatever.Åh
ÅhIÅfll take care of Atlanta.
 So, about my reward...Åh
Chao ÅhYes, I understand.
      Your reward will be the N Key that youÅfre searching
      for, Rance-san.Åh
ÅhHow do you know IÅfm looking for the N Key?Åh
Chao ÅhItÅfs because youÅfre famous, Rance-sama.
      Celebrities donÅft get privacy.Åh
ÅhI really donÅft enjoy the violation of my privacy, but
 youÅfll really give me the N Key, right?Åh
Chao ÅhOf course.Åh
ÅhGot it.
 IÅfll accept.Åh
Chao ÅhThank you very much.
      I thought you would accept my request.Åh
ÅhWell, just leave it to me.Åh
When I tried to stand up, Chao stopped me.
Chao ÅhPlease wait.Åh
Chao ÅhWould you like to know a phrase thatÅfs absolutely
      indispensable for exploring this dungeon?Åh
ÅhA phrase..??Åh
Chao ÅhItÅfs an activation code for one of the dungeonÅfs
      elevators.Åh
Chao ÅhThe activation code for the elevator is ÅfCharge.Åf
      Please donÅft forget it.Åh
ÅhCharge..?Åh
Chao ÅhBut it can only be used in the First Elevator.Åh
Chao ÅhWell then, please do your best.
      IÅfll be waiting for a new legend about you,
      Rance-sama.Åh
Chao ÅhPlease do your best, Rance-san.Åh
ÅhMmhmm.Åh
Chao ÅhOh, Rance-san.
      I thought youÅfd show up soon.Åh
Chao ÅhYouÅfve saved your two friends from AtlantaÅfs
      mirror, I see.
      Congratulations.Åh
Åh....How do you know that?
 I havenÅft told you yet.Åh
Chao ÅhInformation about the hero isnÅft private.Åh
Chao ÅhEveryone knows about your exploits.
      Rance-san the hero saved his companions..
      There are many rumors about it around here.Åh
ÅhGahahaha, itÅfs tough being famous!
 I see, I see.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, donÅft you think this is a little strange?
 There shouldnÅft be any people other than Chao-san around
 here..Åh
ÅhShut up. IÅfm famous.
 ThatÅfs a good enough explanation.Åh
Chao ÅhRance-san, may I continue our conversation?Åh
ÅhSure.Åh
Chao ÅhSo you succeeded in rescuing your companions,
      Rance-san.Åh
ÅhIt was super easy.Åh
Chao ÅhI thought you could defeat Atlanta, Rance-san.
      No, I knew.Åh
ÅhWell of course I could.Åh
Chao ÅhAtlanta is on the fifth floor that can only be
      reached using the Second Elevator.Åh
Chao ÅhThe password for the Second Elevator is Sirius.
      Please remember it.Åh
ÅhSirius, Sirius, Sirius.Åh
ÅhSirius, right? I got it.Åh
ÅhBy the way, why didnÅft you just tell me that password to
 begin with?Åh
ÅhIf IÅfd known it, IÅfd have been able to defeat Atlanta a
 lot sooner.Åh
Chao ÅhAtlanta is amazingly powerful.
      If I told someone where she was without knowing the
      extent of their abilities, IÅfd.....Åh
ÅhIn other words, you wanted to test me first.Åh
Chao ÅhIÅfm sorry.Åh
ÅhWell, itÅfs fine.
 Anyway, IÅfll defeat Atlanta.Åh
ÅhIÅfll be looking forward to what comes after that too.Åh
Chao ÅhYes.
      IÅfll clean up and wait for you.Åh
ÅhHohohoho, alright!
 LetÅfs go!Åh
Chao ÅhHello, Rance-san.Åh
ÅhYep.Åh
Chao ÅhFrom the looks of it, you managed to defeat
      Atlanta, right?
      Congratulations.Åh
ÅhYep, of course.
 That weak-ass witch was never any danger to me.Åh
Chao ÅhThatÅfs amazing. I knew a hero like you could do
      it.Åh
ÅhNow then, how about you keep your promise?Åh
ÅhWeÅfre gonna fuck.
 Also, the N Key.Åh
Chao ÅhI understand.Åh
ÅhI see. Then right away...
 Heeheehee!Åh
Chao ÅhPlease wait for now.
      The N Key is an extremely important item, so IÅfve
      hidden it on the lowest floor.Åh
Chao ÅhIÅfll go down to the lowest floor first, get the N
      Key, and wait for you.Åh
ÅhI see. Then how do we get to the lowest floor?
 YouÅfre not planning on running away, are you?Åh
Chao ÅhI wonÅft run. IÅfll be waiting for you, Rance-san.Åh
Chao ÅhTo get to the lowest floor, enter the Second
      Elevator and intone the password [Lexington].Åh
ÅhLexington, eh? Alright, I got it.Åh
Chao ÅhWell then, IÅfll head there first.Åh
Chao ÅhAlso, could you come to the lowest floor alone,
      Rance-san?
      IÅfm just so shy.Åh
With that, Chao left the room.
ÅhItÅfs a trap, Rance-sama!
 You mustnÅft go alone!Åh
ÅhFufufufufu,
 sheÅfs waiting for me!Åh
ÅhFufufufu, and sheÅfs shy so I should come alone!
 How cute!Åh
ÅhRance-sama, Chao-san is just a form AtlantaÅfs taken to
 deceive you!
 Rance-samaaa.. come on!Åh
Åh...Oh, right, right.
 Shit, what a bitch! Playing around with a manÅfs heart
 like this!Åh
Chao ÅhAtlanta should be on the 5th floor, through the
      Second Elevator.
      Please do your best.Åh
.........
Chao ÅhRance-san, what is it?Åh
ÅhI get that IÅfm supposed to be exterminating Atlanta.
 IÅfm working on it now.Åh
Chao ÅhYes, please work hard.Åh
ÅhSo just let me do you a little.
 IÅfm so horny I canÅft concentrate.Åh
Chao ÅhIf the hero, Rance-san, is asking something of me,
      IÅfd like to do anything in my power, but....Åh
ÅhThen let me do you.Åh
Chao ÅhThis is a dangerous day for me.
      In a little bit, like after youÅfve defeated
      Atlanta...Åh
ÅhBut I want to fuck you now.Åh
Chao ÅhI know... Then, can you make do with this?Åh
   (Smooch)
Chao gave me a little kiss.
Chao ÅhThe rest will be after you defeat Atlanta..
      Okay?Åh
ÅhUgh.. Okay.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, itÅfs a treasure chest.
 What should I do?Åh
LetÅfs see...
Should she open it?
ÅhDonÅft open it.
 DO NOT open it.Åh
ÅhOkay, got it.
 I WILL NOT open it.Åh
ÅhAlright, do your best to open it.Åh
ÅhOkay, IÅfll try.Åh
(Rustle rustle rustle)
(Clack)
ÅhRance-sama, itÅfs open!Åh
ÅhI foundÅF 
 inside.Åh
ÅhAlright, hold onto it.Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
ÅhIÅfve finally find you, Atlanta.
 Your evil deeds end here!Åh
Atlanta Åh.......Åh
ÅhI will defeat you.
 YouÅfve got a pretty nice body too, so I think IÅfll hurt
 you enough that you canÅft move anymore and weÅfll have
 some fun!Åh
Atlanta Åh........Åh
ÅhLetÅfs go!Åh
Atlanta Åh........Åh
ÅhNow then, time for fun...!Åh
But when I tried to pounce on her, Atlanta disappeared.
ÅhShe vanished. So she died..? Tch.Åh
ÅhRance-sama....Åh
ÅhWell, whatever.
 I didnÅft get to fuck her, but I defeated her.Åh
ÅhI defeated her perfectly.Åh
ÅhI definitely defeated her.Åh
ÅhAll thatÅfs left is to get the N Key from Chao.
 And.. mmfufufu!Åh
ÅhCan you seriously not think about anything but that,
 Rance?Åh
ÅhOf course!Åh
Ted ÅhOhh, great warrior!
     Please save me!Åh
ÅhNo!Åh
Ted ÅhHeh...? ArenÅft you a warrior of justice?Åh
Ted ÅhHaah, haah, haah.. YouÅfre terrible.
     Please, help me!Åh
Åh....No.Åh
Ted Åh.....You brute.Åh
Ted Åh...........Åh
ÅhWhat is it? Not gonna say Åfsave meÅf?Åh
Ted ÅhYou wouldnÅft save me anyway, right?
     ThereÅfs no point in saying it.Åh
ÅhGahahahahaha, thatÅfs exactly right!Åh
ÅhGahahahahahaha, this is fun!Åh
ÅhAlright, IÅfm gonna step on it.Åh
(Squish)
(Spin spin spin)
Man ÅhOwah....!Åh
ÅhGahahahaha, this is funny!Åh
ÅhAlright, spin!Åh
(Spin spin spin)
Man ÅhOwawawawawawawah!!Åh
(Spin spin spin)
Man ÅhUgyaaaaaaaah!Åh
(Clank)
With a loud sound, the door opened.
ÅhRance-sama, it looks like this button opens the door.Åh
Ted ÅhYeah, it is! Shit!Åh
Ted ÅhNothingÅfs gonna happen if you step on it again.
     YouÅfve got some talent for evil.
     Go ahead and go through.Åh
ThereÅfs a girl chained to the wall.
And sheÅfs naked.
ÅhMmfufufufufufu.Åh
Nanami ÅhOh, please help me!
        A terrible Devil captured me and is holding me
        here!Åh
ÅhI see, I see.
 Then IÅfll save you, but only after I take care of
 something.Åh
Nanami ÅhSomething??Åh
Nanami ÅhKya!!Åh
I casually grabbed NanamiÅfs breasts.
Nanami ÅhPlease donÅft do anything dirty!Åh
ÅhBut I canÅft ignore your naked body.
 Just let me do you a little.Åh
Nanami ÅhYouÅfre just as terrible as a bandit!Åh
ÅhYou canÅft compare a hero of justice like me to a bandit!
 Well now IÅfve got to give you some punishment in the
 name of justice, donÅft I?Åh
ÅhGahahahahaha, good!Åh
Nanami Åh...YouÅfre terrible.Åh
(Clank)
With a loud sound, the door opened.
ÅhHm.....?Åh
Nanami ÅhYouÅfve got a talent for evil.
        Go ahead and pass.Åh
ÅhWhat the hell are you?Åh
Nanami Åh........Åh
Nanami ÅhGo through the door.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, weÅfve collected all of Kanami-sanÅfs mirror
 fragments.Åh
ÅhThen IÅfll put them together.Åh
The four mirror fragments clinked as Sill put them
together.
ÅhI did it!Åh
ÅhOhh, itÅfs so lewd!
 I can see it all.. deheh, deheh.Åh
(Snap)
The mirror disappeared with a snapping sound.
Åh*So-ob*, that was terrible!Åh
ÅhI got a nice look at your naked body.
 I looked so much at your pussy that I think IÅfve
 memorized it.Åh
ÅhStupid!Åh
ÅhAnyway, now IÅfve saved you AGAIN!
 YouÅfd better have more appreciation for me than all the
 water in the sea!Åh
Åh.........Åh
ÅhNow go back to town, you loser.Åh
ÅhI- I got it already.Åh
Kanami used a Return Wood to return to town.
ÅhArenÅft you glad Kanami-sanÅfs alright, Rance-sama?Åh
Åh.......A little, I guess.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, weÅfve collected all of Leila-sanÅfs mirror
 fragments.Åh
ÅhThen IÅfll put them together.Åh
The four mirror fragments clinked as Sill put them
together.
ÅhOhh, what an enticing pose.
 Leila-sanÅfs body is really nice.Åh
(Snap)
The mirror disappeared with a snapping sound.
ÅhPhew, that was terrible.
 Thanks for saving me, Rance-kun.Åh
ÅhIf youÅfre gonna thank me, let me have sex with you!Åh
ÅhGeez, nothing but that, all the time.Åh
ÅhSo let me do you.Åh
ÅhNo way. Anything but that.
 IÅfm sorry, Rance-kun.Åh
ÅhOooooh....Åh
ÅhWhatever. Just get back to town.Åh
ÅhI guess I will. IÅfll be waiting for you.Åh
Leila-san used a Return Wood and returned to town.
