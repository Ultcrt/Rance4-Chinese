...A monster attacked.
Leave the room?
Itfs a bookshelf.
Hmm? Therefs stuff like poetry anthologies.
hRance-sama, I want some poetry anthologies too.h
hBoring. Poetry is trash.h
h........h
Itfs a bookshelf.
Hmm? I canft read these books at all.
hItfs a trolley, Rance-sama.h
hCheck to see if therefs anything valuable in it.h
hYes.h
(Rustle rustle rustle)
hI donft know what any of these balls and tools are for,
 and I donft see anything that looks valuable.h
Itfs a Maus, a kind of Magic Unit.
It looks pretty complete, but I guess it isnft yet.
Itfd be trouble if it started moving, so Ifm gonna put
some snot on it.
(Stick)
hRance-sama... what are you...??h
hIfm putting my holy snot on it!
 Now he canft move!
 Gahahahahahaha....!h
h.......h
hWhat a nice chair, Rance-sama.h
hYeah, but it looks hard.
 Itfs got no cushions or anything.h
(Bang bang)
I hit the seat of the chair and is made a hard sound.
hI want a fluffy chair that you sink into when you sit on
 it.h
hYeah, a chair about as soft as this...h
hKyan!h
I stroked Šó˜Ifs butt.
hOh, Rance-sama....h
Just a normal chair.
Doesnft look like therefs anything strange about it.
Itfs a Magic Unit, a Maus.
Looks like it was in the middle of being made and isnft
complete yet.
Hanny hWelcome, sir!h
Hanny hPlease buy something, sir!h
Hanny hNo one comes to shop in a place like this, sir.
       But it doesnft cost anything to set up here.h
Hanny hWhat would you like, sir?h
Hanny hOne 
, yes?
       Thatfll be 
 gold.h
Hanny h*Sob*, couldnft sell again today, huh?h
Hanny h*Sob*, you donft have enough money, sir.h
Hanny hThank you, sir.h
I bought the 
.
hWhat the heckfs this?h
hItfs an army of Mause, Rance-sama!
 Itfd be bad if they all attacked us!h
hWell, it looks like theyfre all dead or hibernating
 anyway.h
hMerim, dfyou know what this is?h
hThis looks like a hangar for the Magic Units that
 supported the Toushin Toshifs primary weapons, the
 Tousho.h
hThese look like Mause, one of the later varieties.h
hMause, eh?h
hThere are a bunch of other kinds of Magic Units, like
 the Elefant, Nashorn, and Dora, but I donft see any of
 them here.h
hTheir features are..h
hThatfs enough.h
I canft listen to everything Merim says or shefll go on
forever.
Therefs a small donation box.
hŠó˜I, there might be change in here.
 Get the money out.h
hWefll be punished, Rance-sama.
 These are a godfs offerings.h
hI donft care. Ifm a god.
 If theyfre for a god, theyfre for me.h
hOkay.h
Šó˜I stuck her hand in the donation box and fished around
inside.
hWell? Find anything?h
h........h
hI think itfs empty. I canft find anything.h
hShit, how disappointing.h
hIfm gonna destroy iiiit!!h
(Thwack thwack thwack)
(Whack whack whack)
I punched and kicked the donation box as hard as I could,
but I didnft put so much as a scratch on it.
hItfs a sturdy donation box, isnft it, Rance-sama?h
(Whack)
hOwwww!h
hRance-sama, it says that if you put 1,000 gold in the
 donation box, the southern door will open.
 Do you want to put more in?h
hWhofd put more money in, you dumbass?h
hI suppose youfre right.h
hRance-sama, therefs something written on the donation
 box.
 Ifll read it.h
hMm.h
hLetfs see... fIf you put 1,000 gold into this donation
 box, the southern door will open.f is what it says.h
hWhatfs that mean?h
hI donft really know, but I guess putting 1,000 gold in
 will open a door.
 Should we put something in it?h
(Clank clank)
I put 1,000 gold in the donation box.
h...I feel like this is kind of a waste, Rance-sama.h
hYoufre gonna make up this money later.h
h...Eh?h
hIfm gonna put half in. 500 gold.
 There.h
(Clank clank)
I put 500 gold in the donation box.
hRance-sama, half might not work.h
(Clink)
I put the huge amount of 1 gold in the donation box.
hI put in 1 gold. Something goodfs bound to happen.h
hHopefully.h
(Spit spit)
I spit in the donation box.
hThatfs gross, Rance-sama.h
hWhat? You think my holy salivafs fgrossf?h
I grabbed Šó˜I and gave her a really a really hot, wet
kiss.
hAh..!h
I twine my tongue around hers and make sure a bunch of my
spit gets in her mouth.
hPhew, dfyou still think my salivafs gross?h
h....No.h
hCould you not?h
hWhat, you want a kiss from me too, ‰Á“Ş”ü?h
hNo thanks.h
Putting my money in a donation box is beyond stupid.
I canft do it.
hRance-sama, we donft have enough.h
F  Deadly Poison Jar              F
FThe poison in this jar will kill F
Fanyone who so much as touches it.F
FDo not put your hand in.         F
Therefs a large jar packed with a creepy green liquid.
Therefs probably nothing else in it.
hIt looks like a jar of poison, Rance-sama.
 Itfs dangerous, so letfs not touch it.h
hYeah, itfs kind of an acidic color, so itfs almost
 definitely poison.h
hBut if you were really desperate to hide something,
 donft you think this would be perfect?h
Well, what should we do?
hThere must be something in there.
 Somebodyfs gonna have to stick a hand in.h
hŠó˜I, put your hand in.h
hBut itfs poison!
 Please donft make me!h
hNope.
 Do it.h
h.........h
Šó˜I slowly, fearfully stuck her hand in the jar.
hKya!!!!!h
Šó˜I took damage from the poison and was reduced to 1 HP.
hRance-sama, my hand hurts.
 *Sob* *sob*.h
hDonft cry, you were just unlucky.h
h‰Á“Ş”ü, stick your hand in the jar and see if therefs
 anything in there.h
hNo, donft be ridiculous.
 Why donft you do it?h
hBut itfd be terrible if I got hurt.h
hWh- then you donft care what happens to me!!?h
hYep, so hurry it up.h
I grabbed ‰Á“Ş”üfs arm and forced her hand into the jar.
hKya.. Ow!!h
‰Á“Ş”ü took damage from the poison and was reduced to 1
HP.
hLooks like it was poison after all.h
hYou brute!!h
hàó—˜ˆŸ, put your hand in this jar and check it out.h
hI donft have to put my hand in to check it out.h
àó—˜ˆŸ took a small square of paper out of her pocket and
held it up.
hItfs litmus paper!h
hUh huh. Whatfs that?h
hThis is paper that analyzes a liquidfs composition.
 You just put some of the liquid on it like this..h
àó—˜ˆŸ dipped the weird paper in the liquid and showed it
to me.
hSee? It says fpoisonf right here.h
I certainly could see the word fpoisonf appearing faintly
on the paper.
hSee? Isnft litmus paper handy?h
hI see, so itfs poison....h
hYeah, letfs leave the dangerous shit to Feliss.h
hFeliss, get out here.h
(Poof)
Feliss appeared from the Devil Realm.
hWhat do you need, Master..?
 Hmmm, Ifve got a bad feeling about this.h
hStick your hand in this jar and see if therefs anything
 inside it.h
hThis jar....? Ugh!h
hItfs a jar of poison!
 No way, I donft want to!h
hHm? You canft obey the words of your master?h
h....F-fine.
 Ifll do it, okay? Happy now?h
Feliss timidly stuck her hand into the jar.
h*Gasp*... ow.. ow.. argh!h
hWell? Is there something in there?h
hWait.. whatfs.. there!h
Feliss brought her hand, burned and releasing some kind
of white smoke, out of the jar along with a shiny thing.
hDevils can feel pain too, you know.
 Please donft give me such unreasonable orders.h
hGahahahahaha, good work.
 Anyway, hand it over.h
I took the ruby from Feliss.
hIfm going home then.h
(Poof)
Feliss returned to the Devil Realm.
hŠó˜I, look more closely at the jar.
 There might be some kind of trick to it.h
hYes, okay.h
Šó˜I started nervously investigating the jar.
hWell? Figured anything out?h
hIt doesnft look like therefs any magic on it, and
 nothing seems particularly suspicious about it.h
For some reason, a girl is sitting at a tea table.
Chao hHello, travelers.
      My name is Chao.h
Chao hTherefs no need to stand over there. Why not have
      tea with me?h
hOkay, sure.h
I sat down across from Chao.
When I sat down, Chao started crying.
hHey, wait a second, why are you crying?
 I havenft even done anything!h
Chao hIfm sorry, Ifm just.. so sad.h
hWhat are you sad about?
 Just tell me about it. Ifll listen.h
Chao hThank you so much, Rance-san.
      But please have some delicious tea first.h
Chao offered me some tea.
h....How do you know my name?
 I havenft said it yet.h
Chao took a sip of tea before answering my question.
Chao hThatfs just common knowledge.
      Everyone knows about Rance-san, the strongest
      adventurer of the century.h
Chao hI hear hefs strong, smart, overflowing with a sense
      of justice, and an overall wonderful person.h
hYup, seems like youfve just perfectly described me!h
(Sssiiip)
hThis is pretty good tea.
 Are you using some kinda famous tea leaves?h
Chao hNo, itfs just third-rate tea they sell in stores.h
h........h
Chao hBy the way, Rance-san.
      I have a favor Ifd like to ask of you.. May I?h
hIfve never turned down a beautiful womanfs request.h
Chao hJust what I would expect from Rance-san.h
hGahahahahahahahaha!h
Chao hIfd like you to exterminate the witch, Atlanta, who
      lives in this dungeon.h
hAtlanta the witch??h
Chao hYes, shefs an evil witch who serves a Dark Lord.h
Chao hItfs said that she traps people in mirrors.h
Chao took another sip of tea there.
hSo thatfs the reason youfre sad.
 A lover or relative of yours got stuck in one of
 Atlantafs mirrors, right?h
Chao h...Ifll go with that.h
h???h
hWell, whatever.h
hIfll take care of Atlanta.
 So, about my reward...h
Chao hYes, I understand.
      Your reward will be the N Key that youfre rõing
      for, Rance-san.h
hHow do you know Ifm looking for the N Key?h
Chao hItfs because youfre famous, Rance-sama.
      Celebrities donft get privacy.h
hI really donft enjoy the violation of my privacy, but
 youfll really give me the N Key, right?h
Chao hOf course.h
hGot it.
 Ifll accept.h
Chao hThank you very much.
      I thought you would accept my request.h
hWell, just leave it to me.h
When I tried to stand up, Chao stopped me.
Chao hPlease wait.h
Chao hWould you like to know a phrase thatfs absolutely
      indispensable for exploring this dungeon?h
hA phrase..??h
Chao hItfs an activation code for one of the dungeonfs
      elevators.h
Chao hThe activation code for the elevator is fCharge.f
      Please donft forget it.h
hCharge..?h
Chao hBut it can only be used in the First Elevator.h
Chao hWell then, please do your best.
      Ifll be waiting for a new legend about you,
      Rance-sama.h
Chao hPlease do your best, Rance-san.h
hMmhmm.h
Chao hOh, Rance-san.
      I thought youfd show up soon.h
Chao hYoufve saved your two friends from Atlantafs
      mirror, I see.
      Congratulations.h
h....How do you know that?
 I havenft told you yet.h
Chao hInformation about the hero isnft private.h
Chao hEveryone knows about your exploits.
      Rance-san the hero saved his companions..
      There are many rumors about it around here.h
hGahahaha, itfs tough being famous!
 I see, I see.h
hRance-sama, donft you think this is a little strange?
 There shouldnft be any people other than Chao-san around
 here..h
hShut up. Ifm famous.
 Thatfs a good enough explanation.h
Chao hRance-san, may I continue our conversation?h
hSure.h
Chao hSo you succeeded in rescuing your companions,
      Rance-san.h
hIt was super easy.h
Chao hI thought you could defeat Atlanta, Rance-san.
      No, I knew.h
hWell of course I could.h
Chao hAtlanta is on the fifth floor that can only be
      reached using the Second Elevator.h
Chao hThe password for the Second Elevator is Sirius.
      Please remember it.h
hSirius, Sirius, Sirius.h
hSirius, right? I got it.h
hBy the way, why didnft you just tell me that password to
 begin with?h
hIf Ifd known it, Ifd have been able to defeat Atlanta a
 lot sooner.h
Chao hAtlanta is amazingly powerful.
      If I told someone where she was without knowing the
      extent of their abilities, Ifd.....h
hIn other words, you wanted to test me first.h
Chao hIfm sorry.h
hWell, itfs fine.
 Anyway, Ifll defeat Atlanta.h
hIfll be looking forward to what comes after that too.h
Chao hYes.
      Ifll clean up and wait for you.h
hHohohoho, alright!
 Letfs go!h
Chao hHello, Rance-san.h
hYep.h
Chao hFrom the looks of it, you managed to defeat
      Atlanta, right?
      Congratulations.h
hYep, of course.
 That weak-ass witch was never any danger to me.h
Chao hThatfs amazing. I knew a hero like you could do
      it.h
hNow then, how about you keep your promise?h
hWefre gonna fuck.
 Also, the N Key.h
Chao hI understand.h
hI see. Then right away...
 Heeheehee!h
Chao hPlease wait for now.
      The N Key is an extremely important item, so Ifve
      hidden it on the lowest floor.h
Chao hIfll go down to the lowest floor first, get the N
      Key, and wait for you.h
hI see. Then how do we get to the lowest floor?
 Youfre not planning on running away, are you?h
Chao hI wonft run. Ifll be waiting for you, Rance-san.h
Chao hTo get to the lowest floor, enter the Second
      Elevator and intone the password [Lexington].h
hLexington, eh? Alright, I got it.h
Chao hWell then, Ifll head there first.h
Chao hAlso, could you come to the lowest floor alone,
      Rance-san?
      Ifm just so shy.h
With that, Chao left the room.
hItfs a trap, Rance-sama!
 You mustnft go alone!h
hFufufufufu,
 shefs waiting for me!h
hFufufufu, and shefs shy so I should come alone!
 How cute!h
hRance-sama, Chao-san is just a form Atlantafs taken to
 deceive you!
 Rance-samaaa.. come on!h
h...Oh, right, right.
 Shit, what a bitch! Playing around with a manfs heart
 like this!h
Chao hAtlanta should be on the 5th floor, through the
      Second Elevator.
      Please do your best.h
.........
Chao hRance-san, what is it?h
hI get that Ifm supposed to be exterminating Atlanta.
 Ifm working on it now.h
Chao hYes, please work hard.h
hSo just let me do you a little.
 Ifm so horny I canft concentrate.h
Chao hIf the hero, Rance-san, is asking something of me,
      Ifd like to do anything in my power, but....h
hThen let me do you.h
Chao hThis is a dangerous day for me.
      In a little bit, like after youfve defeated
      Atlanta...h
hBut I want to fuck you now.h
Chao hI know... Then, can you make do with this?h
   (Smooch)
Chao gave me a little kiss.
Chao hThe rest will be after you defeat Atlanta..
      Okay?h
hUgh.. Okay.h
hRance-sama, itfs a treasure chest.
 What should I do?h
Letfs see...
Should she open it?
hDonft open it.
 DO NOT open it.h
hOkay, got it.
 I WILL NOT open it.h
hAlright, do your best to open it.h
hOkay, Ifll try.h
(Rustle rustle rustle)
(Clack)
hRance-sama, itfs open!h
hI foundF 
 inside.h
hAlright, hold onto it.h
hYes.h
hIfve finally find you, Atlanta.
 Your evil deeds end here!h
Atlanta h.......h
hI will defeat you.
 Youfve got a pretty nice body too, so I think Ifll hurt
 you enough that you canft move anymore and wefll have
 some fun!h
Atlanta h........h
hLetfs go!h
Atlanta h........h
hNow then, time for fun...!h
But when I tried to pounce on her, Atlanta disappeared.
hShe vanished. So she died..? Tch.h
hRance-sama....h
hWell, whatever.
 I didnft get to fuck her, but I defeated her.h
hI defeated her perfectly.h
hI definitely defeated her.h
hAll thatfs left is to get the N Key from Chao.
 And.. mmfufufu!h
hCan you seriously not think about anything but that,
 Rance?h
hOf course!h
Ted hOhh, great warrior!
     Please save me!h
hNo!h
Ted hHeh...? Arenft you a warrior of justice?h
Ted hHaah, haah, haah.. Youfre terrible.
     Please, help me!h
h....No.h
Ted h.....You brute.h
Ted h...........h
hWhat is it? Not gonna say fsave mef?h
Ted hYou wouldnft save me anyway, right?
     Therefs no point in saying it.h
hGahahahahaha, thatfs exactly right!h
hGahahahahahaha, this is fun!h
hAlright, Ifm gonna step on it.h
(Squish)
(Spin spin spin)
Man hOwah....!h
hGahahahaha, this is funny!h
hAlright, spin!h
(Spin spin spin)
Man hOwawawawawawawah!!h
(Spin spin spin)
Man hUgyaaaaaaaah!h
(Clank)
With a loud sound, the door opened.
hRance-sama, it looks like this button opens the door.h
Ted hYeah, it is! Shit!h
Ted hNothingfs gonna happen if you step on it again.
     Youfve got some talent for evil.
     Go ahead and go through.h
Therefs a girl chained to the wall.
And shefs naked.
hMmfufufufufufu.h
Nanami hOh, please help me!
        A terrible Devil captured me and is holding me
        here!h
hI see, I see.
 Then Ifll save you, but only after I take care of
 something.h
Nanami hSomething??h
Nanami hKya!!h
I casually grabbed Nanamifs breasts.
Nanami hPlease donft do anything dirty!h
hBut I canft ignore your naked body.
 Just let me do you a little.h
Nanami hYoufre just as terrible as a bandit!h
hYou canft compare a hero of justice like me to a bandit!
 Well now Ifve got to give you some punishment in the
 name of justice, donft I?h
hGahahahahaha, good!h
Nanami h...Youfre terrible.h
(Clank)
With a loud sound, the door opened.
hHm.....?h
Nanami hYoufve got a talent for evil.
        Go ahead and pass.h
hWhat the hell are you?h
Nanami h........h
Nanami hGo through the door.h
hRance-sama, wefve collected all of ‰Á“Ş”ü-sanfs mirror
 fragments.h
hThen Ifll put them together.h
The four mirror fragments clinked as Šó˜I put them
together.
hI did it!h
hOhh, itfs so lewd!
 I can see it all.. deheh, deheh.h
(Snap)
The mirror disappeared with a snapping sound.
h*So-ob*, that was terrible!h
hI got a nice look at your naked body.
 I looked so much at your pussy that I think Ifve
 memorized it.h
hStupid!h
hAnyway, now Ifve saved you AGAIN!
 Youfd better have more appreciation for me than all the
 water in the sea!h
h.........h
hNow go back to town, you loser.h
hI- I got it already.h
‰Á“Ş”ü used a Return Wood to return to town.
hArenft you glad ‰Á“Ş”ü-sanfs alright, Rance-sama?h
h.......A little, I guess.h
hRance-sama, wefve collected all of åQf-sanfs mirror
 fragments.h
hThen Ifll put them together.h
The four mirror fragments clinked as Šó˜I put them
together.
hOhh, what an enticing pose.
 åQf-sanfs body is really nice.h
(Snap)
The mirror disappeared with a snapping sound.
hPhew, that was terrible.
 Thanks for saving me, Rance-kun.h
hIf youfre gonna thank me, let me have sex with you!h
hGeez, nothing but that, all the time.h
hSo let me do you.h
hNo way. Anything but that.
 Ifm sorry, Rance-kun.h
hOooooh....h
hWhatever. Just get back to town.h
hI guess I will. Ifll be waiting for you.h
åQf-san used a Return Wood and returned to town.
