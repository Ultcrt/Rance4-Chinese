Unfortunately, I couldnft find any monsters.

h—¢-san....h
hI understand. The male barrier, right?
 Ifll wait for you here then.h
hThanks.h
hBye-bye, —¢-chan.h
hOh? The door wonft open.h
hThatfs unusual.. This door has a male barrier placed on
 it.h
hA male barrier? Whatfs that?h
hA barrier that prevents men from passing through.
 In this case, itfs reacting to —¢-san.h
hI understand. Ifll wait here then.
 You should be able to pass through it if I do.h
hWe will, but...h
hIf youfre worried about me, please donft be.h
hIfm worried about us without you, —¢-san.
 Really now.h
In any case, we wouldnft be able to pass through with
—¢-san, so we had him wait here and entered without
him.
The door wonft open.
The door wonft open.
hTherefs a transport device, —–z-sama.
 Should we use it?h
hLetfs see??h
hAlright, letfs go!h
hYes.h
We stood in the center of the magic circle on the ground.
Ascend stairs?
Ascending to higher floor.
Heading outside.
Descend stairs?
Descending to lower floor.
Doesnft look like therefs any reason to search thoroughly
here.
hThis looks like a manmade dungeon.h
hI wonder who made it...h
hAnyway, letfs look for —–z-dono.h
hRight. But would he even be in this dungeon?h
hWell, he loves burrowing into holes, so therefs a good
 chance hefs underground, right?h
hHe does??h
hJust think that for now. Besides, itfs not like we have
 anywhere else to look for him, so we might as well look
 here.h
hI suppose youfre right.
 He probably wonft just show up if we wait around here.h
hYeah.h
h........I thought so.h
hWhat is it, —¢-san?h
hI sense monsters.h
hReally?h
hDefinitely. There are monsters in this dungeon.h
h...Everyone, make sure youfre on your guard.
 Wefll proceed cautiously.h
hEnemies....!h
hTh.. The Helman Army!h
The mysterious group who suddenly appeared behind us was
an enemy well known to us.
They were soldiers from Helman, old enemies of Leazas.
Why are there Helman soldiers here..?
hKehya, kehya, kehya!
 Thatfs as far as you go, Leazas scum!h
hWhy is the Helman Army here..?h
hThis Toushin Toshi is mine.
 I have no intention of giving it to you.h
hToushin Toshi...??h
hNow, crush them!h
hHold on a second..!h
hPrepare yourselves, Helman dogs!h
hYoufre too strong, Red Death...
 But I canft die here.
 Dens, wefre retreating.h
hOkay, Hu.h
hHey, I havenft ordered you to retreat!
 Fight! Fight and defeat that Leazas scum!h
hHmph, you fight by yourself then.
 I donft want to die in vain.h
hYou.....!h
hAnyway, we should retreat, Bitch-sama...h
hYou plan to run!?
 Youfre a disgrace to knights!h
hIfm not a knight, Ifm just a warrior!h
h! ......h
The Helman Army disappeared swiftly.
hCowards.h
hWhy is the Helman Army...?
 Are they after —–z, too..?
 Well, Ifm sure Helman hates him.h
hThe Helman Army isnft the only one who hates —–z.h
hMhmm.h
h........h
hMore importantly, Ifm worried about what that man said
 about fnot giving us the Toushin Toshi.f
 Therefs something going on here.h
hWell, therefs no denying that wefve got enemies here.h
hI do not believe they are capable of defeating us, the
 elite of Leazas, but we donft know what methods theyfll
 employ, so we should be cautious.h
hNdaba, carry to storehouse.h
Saying that, the Magic Farmer handed me a key.
Obtained Storehouse Key.
hNext order.
 Clean drain.h
hClean the drain? Youfve gotta be kidding me.h
héä»‰ë doesnft like getting dirty.h
hSouth aqueduct doesnft flow well.
 Something must be stuck.
 Remove it.h
hSomethingfs stuck? I wonder if itfs..h
hSouth aqueduct.
 Hurry and check.h
hGood timing.h
hWhat is it? Are you gonna give us sweets?h
hBring Î”ÂÄ“y“¤.
 Hurry.h
hHm? Itfs giving orders to humans?h
hDoesnft look like it.
 Hefs confusing us for Magic Farmers.
 Thatfs why hefs giving us orders.h
hI donft really like being mistaken for something as
 weird as this thing.h
hHurry and bring Î”ÂÄ“y“¤.h
hHurry and bring Î”ÂÄ“y“¤.h
hHere you go.
 We brought it for you.h
I handed the Î”ÂÄ“y“¤ over to the Magic Farmer.
hNext bring ”Ñ’c.h
hW-what?
 Wefre not your underlings, you know.h
hCalm down, u—¥.
 Theyfre just confusing us for Magic Farmers.h
hThatfs whatfs pissing me off.h
hHurry and bring ”Ñ’c.h
hWork quickly.h
hHurry and give me ”Ñ’c.h
hHere you go.h
I handed the ”Ñ’c over to the Magic Farmer.
hNext...h
hEhh, therefs more?h
hOf course.
 We Magic Farmers work until we die.h
h.....Until they die..
 éä»‰ëfs glad shefs not a Magic Farmer.h
hNext, bring ™Ö“¿f‘.h
hThis guy pisses me off.
 If he were asking —–z for this crap, hefd definitely
 be dead.h
hYoufre right about that.
 —–z would be scary if he were ordered fbring me thisf
 and fbring me thatf.h
hBring ”Ñ’c.h
hHurry and bring ™Ö“¿f‘.h
hHere you are.h
I handed the ™Ö“¿f‘ over to the Magic Farmer.
hAfter ™Ö“¿f‘, I have next order.h
hWhy are we doing this, Maria?
 Wefre not gonna find —–z like this.h
hI feel the same way.h
hI suppose youfre right, but.. Itfs not like we have
 anything else to do.....h
hNext is important job.
 But save it for tomorrow.h
hToday, rest well.h
hAlright, next job.h
hBring basket full of harvest to Storehouse.h
h......h
hStorehouse Key is under red brick where aqueducts meet.
 Go ahead and take it.h
hGeez, this is pointlessly complicated.h
hPutting key back where you found it after using is
 common sense...h
hDo your best and work.
 This weekfs goal is harvest 0.03% more than last week.h
hWork.h
hWork yourself.
 Ifm gonna play.h
A weird-looking (not human, right?) person was holding a
hoe and doing farmwork.
What the heck is this thing?
Well, letfs try talking to it.
hHello.h
hHello.
 Work.h
hUmm.. what are you doing?h
hPlowing field.
 Heave ho.h
hThis thingfs a Magic Farmer.
 Ifve never seen one before.h
hMagic Farmer?
 You know what it is, u—¥?h
hYeah, I read about them in a grimoire a long time ago.h
hTheyfre scarecrows powered by magic who do farmwork
 forever.h
hThey canft produce anything that requires complex
 knowledge or experience, but they can produce simple
 things.h
hThatfs amazing.
 If you had a bunch of them, couldnft you eliminate
 hunger and poverty?h
hBut éä»‰ë has a question. Wouldnft farmers all lose
 their jobs then? —¢-chanfs papafs a farmer, right?
 So hefd be in trouble!h
hYou donft need to worry about that. Itfs difficult to
 make these Magic Farmers. Itfs impossible for anyone
 without considerable magic power.h
hCould you make one, u—¥-chan?h
hI think I could, but I donft know the spell.
 I only study combat ones, so.h
hHmmm. But that means theyfre not alive, right?
 Theyfre just scarecrows growing food for humans?h
hYeah.h
hThen that must mean therefs someone on this continent
 somewhere making them work....h
hI see. That sounds reasonable.h
hIt couldnft be —–z, could it?h
hThatfs impossible.
 Therefs no way he could ever do anything productive.h
hAll he can do is destroy and loot everything in his
 path.
 If it were him, hefd be doing slash-and-burn farming.h
hThen who are they producing these crops for?h
hWork, work.h
hHey, Mr. Magic Farmer?
 Whofs your master?h
hWork, work.
 Order is farmwork.h
hDoesnft look like therefs any point in asking.h
hThat key should be around here.
 Letfs look for it.h
hHey, itfs a red brick!
 Think he meant this?h
hThere really is just one thatfs a different color.h
hIndeed. Then allow me...h
hWh.. what was that?h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!h
hYoufre no trouble at all without those two warriors!h
hC.. cowards!h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!
 Winning is the most important part of battle.
 Now, we fight!h
h.......h
hThatfs enough!h
håQf-san..!h
h—¢ will be up soon too.
 Youfd better be ready.h
hShit! This is all because you didnft hurry up and deal
 with them, ‹x”Œ“Á... You incompetent fool.h
hI think the incompetent one is the one who put together
 this underhanded plan.h
hKuh.. Anyway, wefre retreating!
 Remember this, Leazas scum!h
The Helman Army retreated.
hPhew, that was close.h
hGeez, what cowards.h
h......h
hHuh? —¢-san?h
hCute! So —¢-chanfs cute!
 I thought hefd look scarier!h
h*Sigh*....h
hYou seem kinda different.
 Are you really —¢-san?h
hYep. This is the true face of Leazasf feared Red Death,
 —¢.h
hUmm.. Monsters might attack us.. and Ifm scared, so why
 donft we go back for the day?h
h—¢-sanfs scared of monsters..
 Has his personality changed too?h
hYep. —¢ becomes a scared boy without his helmet.
 Itfs a kind of multiple personalities, I suppose.h
hWell this is a problem.h
hI- Ifm sorry.h
hYou donft need to apologize, geez.h
hCute!h
hSo wherefs —¢-sanfs helmet??h
hIt looks like it was washed away when we fell into the
 aqueduct.h
hYeah....h
hAnyway, looks like we should probably head back.h
We used a Return Bonsai to return to the Tulip #4.
EEEEEE@Retuuurn@EEEEEEE
hThen please allow me to join the party again.h
hPhew, what a relief.
 It really is scary without —¢-san.h
hYeah.h
—¢ joined the party.
Hanny hHello.
       This is my private property, so youfll have to pay
       a toll to get through.h
Hanny hThe toll is an ”Ñ’c or a ¢FŠà.
       Either will do.h
Give him...?
Hanny hYou donft want to pass, huh?
       Thatfs too bad.h
The Hanny turned us away.
Hanny hLiar, you donft even have any!
       *Fume* *fume*.h
Handed (”Ñ’c) over to Hanny.
Hanny hThank you! Go ahead, pass.h
The Hanny let us through.
We went down the northward path.
Handed ¢FŠà over to Hanny.
Hanny hThanks, these are my favorite!h
The Hanny let us through.
We went down the southward path.
A Hanny is rolling around on the path to the north and we
canft get through.
hKuh, this stupid Hanny!
 Ifll kill you if you get in my way!h
hDaaaaah!!h
(Hit hit hit hit)
(Hit hit hit whack)
hThis Hanny seems very sturdy, —–z-sama. I donft think
 itfs going to break.h
hShit, so we canft take this path.h
hItfs too bad.
 Letfs go back.h
We couldnft go north because of the Hanny blocking the
path.
A Hanny is rolling around on the path to the south and we
canft get through.
hPlease move, Mr. Hanny.h
Hanny h*Snore* *snore* *snore*.h
h........h
We couldnft go south.
A Hanny is rolling around on the path to the south and we
canft get through.
hKuh, whatfs with this dumbass!!?h
I kicked the annoying Hanny blocking our path, but he
didnft budge.
hShit! Šó˜I!h
hYes, —–z-sama?h
hMove this thing!h
hOkay, Ifll try.h
hHeave ho, heave ho!h
Šó˜I tried to move the Hanny, but it didnft show any
signs of budging.
hPhew. Rance-sama.
 I couldnft do it.h
hAhhh, Ifm pissed!h
We had no choice but to give up on going south.
Sailor hThe enemy of society, of girls, and of good
        sense! Rance, messenger of evil!
        This time, youfll pay!h
h.......h
Sailor hOh, Ifm sorry.
        I thought you were Rance.h
hWait a second, you know Rance?h
Sailor h............h
The Sailor giggled and disappeared without answering my
question.
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
–  At that time                            –
–     Tousho Core  Helman Explorers@@@     –
––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
hReally, I was embarrassed back there because of you
 fools.
 To think wefd lose to Leazas scum...h
hYou people are here to protect me.
 Youfre complete simpletons.h
h...........h
h...........h
hItfd better be here, ”~ä»›G.h
hYes, it should.h
hA Tousho, eh? A great weapon from the past sounds good.
 Itfs perfect for my guard.h
hIf I obtain a Tousho, Ifll have no need for you fools
 anymore.
 Kehya, kehya, kehya!h
hItfs not here either..h
hHey, ”~ä»›G.
 The manmade guards of the Toushin Toshi are really here,
 right?
 We havenft found any of them yet.h
h.......They should be here..h
hReally, I brought you all the way here and youfre
 absolutely useless.
 My luck with subordinates is terrible.h
hNo matter how skilled I am, if you guys keep pulling me
 down all the time...h
hI found one, Bitch-sama!h
hWhat?h
hThis doll is a Tousho?h
hI think so.
 Probably.h
hHmmm, this is, huh?
 It looks pretty strong.h
hHu, th-this is, amazing.h
h......h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!
 Well then, ”~ä»›G.
 Make it move according to my orders!h
h...I canft.h
hYou canft...?h
hYes, it looks like this Tousho has been made to sleep
 somehow.
 I think if we gave its brain some kind of magic stimulus
 it would wake up though.h
hIs there anything else?h
hTousho take their orders from the head of a Toushin
 Toshi and donft take orders from anyone else.
 Even if we can get it moving, I donft know whether or
 not it will listen to your orders... Bitch-sama.h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!
 Donft worry about that.
 Why donft I make it so that it has no choice but to
 listen to my orders?h
h...What are you planning?h
hIfll use these specially made Helman Puchi Hanny
 explosives.
 Ifll put them inside this dollfs body.
 And if it doesnft listen to my orders...h
hKaboooom.h
hGeez, nothing but underhanded schemes...h
hWell then, Ifll plant the explosives.h
Bitch planted explosives in the Toushofs body.
hAlright, letfs wake it up.
 ”~ä»›G, we need to provide the doll with magic energy in
 order to wake it up, yes?h
hYes, but.. Itfs impossible with ˆÉ‰œ-san, our mage, not
 here...h
hIfm here, arenft I?
 Ifll give it some of my perfect divine magic!h
hHaaaaaaaaaah....!h
hHaaaaaaaaaaah....!h
hHaaaaaah....
 Haah,
 haah!h
hWhatfs wrong? Ifm pouring so much magic into it and yet
 itfs not moving.h
hWh.. why doesnft it move? You were mistaken, werenft
 you, ”~ä»›G?h
hEh? That canft be right.
 Umm.. It could be that Bitch-samafs power...h
hWhat are you trying to say about my power?h
hYour power canft move the damn Tousho.
 Right, ”~ä»›G?h
hEh..? Well.. yes.h
hKuh.. what a cheeky doll!h
h.....Well, fine.
 There was a mage among that Leazas Army group.
 Wefll capture her.h
hA Leazas soldier?h
hYes, wefll capture her, make her submit to me, and have
 her help get this doll moving.
 The doll that will murder her comrades, that is.
 Kehya, kehya, kehya!h
..............
hHm? ..This door wonft open.h
hRance-sama, this door has a male barrier placed on it
 and wonft allow men to get through.h
hHrm.. How impudent.
 Discriminating against men is unforgivable.h
hItfs a matter of civil rights!!h
hHey, Rance-chan.h
hWhat is it?h
héä»‰ëfs a girl, so she can go through.
 Are you jealous?h
hKyahahahahahahahaha..!h
hGahahahahahahahahahaha!h
hKyahahahahahahahahahahahahaha..!h
hGahahahahahahahahahaha..!h
hKyahahahahahahahahaha..!h
hShut it.h
(Hit)
I gave éä»‰ë a light smack.
hBooooo, that hurt.h
hAnyway, we need to open the door.h
hŠó˜I, do an Ultra Kick.h
hYes, Rance-sama.h
Šó˜I backed up a little bit and did a dropkick on the
door.
hUltra Kick!!h
(Kaclaaang)
h....*Sob* *sob*, my feet hurt.h
hTch, didnft work, huh.h
But no matter how much I screamed, the door didnft open.
hRance-dono, there are a large amount of Puryo past here,
 so please be careful.h
héä»‰ë haaates Puryo.h
hPuryo, huh? Easy.
 Ifve got nothing to fear from some puny Puryo.h
h........h
hMaria and the rest of fem better be here.h
hThey should be.h
