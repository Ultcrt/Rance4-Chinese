I held the Return Bonsai in both of my hands.
I carefully spun it 2, 3 times.
Then finally a light shone out from the center of the
Return Bonsai.
EEEEEEE(Return!!)EEEEEEEE.
When I realized it, we had returned to the Tulip #4.
I held the Return Bonsai in both hands.
I carefully spun it 2, 3 times.
Then finally a light shone out from the center of the
Return Bonsai.
EEEEEEE(Return!!)EEEEEEEE.
When I realized it, I had returned to town.

hWhy? Thatfs unfair.
 I wanna use it and Ifm important.h
hBut.. I canft do anything about it.h
hHmph, then Ifll do this.h
I embraced Sill and fondled her breasts over her clothes
from behind.
(Fondle fondle fondle fondle)
hOh.. Rance-sama, why are you doing this?h
(Fondle fondle fondle fondle)
(Grip)ƒ|Twist.

I donft really need to think about anything right now.
The world moves according to my will whether or not I
think about it, so Ifm sure everything will work out in
the end.
I AM the main character, and a hero after all!
My fatefs different than the average person who doesnft
know whatfll happen to them next.
Gahahahahahahaha!
First of all, Ifve gotta kill that cocky hag (though Ifm
not sure if Death will even take a bitch like her) and
take back Sill.
Ifll do anything to accomplish that.
A hero such as myself shouldnft have to resort to acting
like a wannabe adventurer and bullying low-level monsters
for experience.. but.. Ifve got no choice.
Ifm gonna kill some small fry monsters and get some
experience points.
Ifve come up with a goal for the time being.
Fucking that Mai girl.
This is a good goal.
Ifm more motivated to accomplish a goal like fucking a
girl than a regular one like defeating evil monsters for
the sake of justice or sealing a terrible, destructive
Demon King. Yup.
Right, in order to fuck Mai, Ifve gotta defeat the Okayu
Fever whofs demanding sacrifices. Alright, letfs go.
Well, Ifve exterminated the evil Okayu Fever demanding
beautiful girl sacrifices.
All thatfs left is...
Heehee.. fucking Mai.
Ifve decided on my next goal.
Ifll check out this Toushin Toshi thing and return to the
surface.
And Ifll accomplish this by... Well, I dunno.
But Ifm sure Ifll find something if I investigate the
underground labyrinths.
ƒƒƒ LV1F
 „„„
The ghost girl Naturi who was in the dungeon.
Ifve gotta save her and find the “Œ•”èoú...
hSill.h
hYes, Rance-sama?
 What is it?h
(Grab.. Fondle fondle)
I suddenly grabbed Sillfs breasts and fondled them.
hAhn...!h
hYup, they still feel good.h
hRance-sama, what was that for??h
hI just did it fcause I wanted to.
 Therefs no other reason.h
hYour only reason for existing is to be there when I want
 some boobs to grab.
 Itfs just like having a lighter for when you want fire.h
h....Okay.h
Ifve gotta obtain that key for ˆÉ‰œ.
I feel like I could do anything for her for some reason.
ˆÉ‰œ wants me to find four keys.
Well, therefs nothing a genius adventurer like me
couldnft find.
I can see ˆÉ‰œfs grateful face already!
.............
h.............h
hIs something wrong, Rance-sama?h
(Pick pick)
Ifm not really in the mood for thinking so I stuck a
finger in my nose and started picking it.
h....??h
I got a big fingerful of snot, so I quickly stuck my
finger into Sillfs fluffy hair and wiped it off.
hKyan!h
hGahahahaha, my nose feels great!h
Well, Ifve found the key to the rerõ room, so I
should use it and thoroughly rõ the room.
I might find something, after all.
hWefre thoroughly rõing the rerõ room.
 Got it, Sill?h
hYes.h
hThere might be something in the back room where that
 Tousho was after all.h
.....Well, the ghost is resting in peace and Ifve done a
good deed. Ifm a shoo-in for heaven now.
Ah, there must be beauties waiting for me in heaven.
But... I canft die yet.
...Women women women women women.
hRance-sama, are you thinking about what we should do
 next?h
hOf course.h
Seems like the weird scientist ”œŠ±’B has made a secret
rerõ lab underground....
I bet hefs doing sexy rerõ.
Capturing young girls... Ooh..!
hWhat is it, Rance-sama?
 Is something the matter?h
hShut up, donft interrupt my thoughts.h
(Smack, hit, kick)
h*So...b*h
Letfs find the “Œ•”èoú.
It should be somewhere around here.
Letfs just find fuckinf ”œŠ±’B and kill fim.
Thatfs enough for now.
First of all, wefve got to explore Ylapu.
Ifm sure Rance and Sill-chan are somewhere here.
Letfs do our best and rõ for them.
What a strange dungeon. Itfs full of fields.
I wonder if Rance and Sill-chan are really here?
And the Helman Army that just attacked us..
This bugs me. What could their objective be..?
Oh.. If the Helman Army is here, then I wonder if theyfve
also invented a flying machine? Whatfll I do if it works
better than my Tulip?
Ifm surprised that —¢-san changes so much just from
losing his helmet.
I bet this is a hsplit personalityh thing.
Anyway, wefre gonna have a lot of problems if we donft
find his helmet and get him back to the strong —¢-san.
We donft know when the Helman Army will attack again.
The helmet probably fell somewhere in that aqueduct.
We should be able to find it if we look there.
Itfs good that we found his helmet and —¢-san is back
to his reliable self.
Looks like it would be good to explore the dungeon more
to find Rance.
....I wonder if Rance is really here.
Ifm starting to worry...
The Helman Armyfs probably gonna attack again..
Hmmmmm.
—¢ and éä»‰ë from Leazas have joined my party.
‰Á“Ş”ü, Leila, àó—˜ˆŸ, and u—¥ should also be here
somewhere.
First, letfs save them and claim, oh, 5 rounds or so of
sex as our reward.
They were lost in the Supply Core. Now, letfs go save
fem.
h‰Á“Ş”ü, I went through all this trouble to save you, so
 you better be grateful forever, okay?h
h....Well, I guess I am a little...h
hA little!? What the heckfs fa littlef to the man who
 saved your life!?
 Why donft you say something like fIfll serve you for the
 rest of my life with my body!f?h
hWhy on earth would I say something like that, loser?h
hYou ungrateful bitch.h
”~ä»›G, the Helman soldier, has suddenly become an ally.
I donft even have to make an effort and girls just flock
to my beauty. Must be my natural talent.
Anyway, this ”~ä»›G girl could be useful at some point, so
I should probably have her join the party.
Those Helman bastards have added a pretty powerful
comrade to their ranks.
What fuckinf cheaters.
I want a powerful subordinate whofll do anything I say.
A beautiful, glamorous one of course...
Sillfs weak, so I donft need fer.
Anyway, itfd be dangerous to fight that Dio Tousho.
We should think of another way to proceed.
.........Hmmm.
I canft think of anything.
Wefve beaten the Octomen, so it looks like wefve got
quite a shortcut now.
The Helman losers are still held up there, so I should
take this opportunity to grab the keys.
Looks like the dragon on the lowest floor of the Defense
Core has the key. Ifm sure itfd be easy to kill it and
take the key, but a dragon might be a little dangerous.
Well, Ifve gotta find the —³‘°Š´–`–ò he
requested if I want to proceed. Tch, this is pissing me
off. I canft believe I have to stoop to this....
Anyway, the Cold Medicine should be in the biggest tower,
the hBuoyancy Staff.h
I guess Ifll go there.
Ifve obtained the —³‘°Š´–`–ò.
Now all Ifve gotta do is get back to the dragon.
ƒƒƒ LV 4F
„„„
Ifve obtained the “ì•”èoú.
The last key is the N Key in the Tousho Core.
Ifll definitely find it.
But the warp point to the Tousho Core is broken and
doesnft work.. This is a problem.
hSill.h
hYes, Rance-sama?h
hI will specially accept any proposals you have as to our
 next course of action, so spill.h
hWell, out of the four keys required to move this Toushin
 Toshi, Rance-sama has the “ì•”èoú and the Helman Army has
 the W Key and the “Œ•”èoú.h
hI think we should prioritize obtaining the final N Key.h
hWell, of course, but to get to the Tousho Core....h
hYes, we canft get there because the warp device is
 broken.
 I think wefll have to look for another passageway.h
hIfm not sure, but maybe we should start by investigating
 the passageway going down from the power room?h
hDown, huh.....?h
hYes, we might be able to get through there.h
hHmmm.h
First I should collect all of these ‹¾”Váê•Ğs.
What troublesome women.
If they were dudes I woulda given up on fem waaaay
earlier.
hRance-sama, what if I got stuck in a mirror?h
hWhat do you mean fwhat iff?h
hWould you try to find me?h
h........h
hNope.
 Ifd abandon you.h
h*Sob* *sob*.h
Ifve collected Leila and ‰Á“Ş”üfs ‹¾”Váê•Ğs.
Geez, that was annoying.
Well, should I go see Chao now?
Chao said Atlants would be on the fifth underground
floor.
Ifll go crush her.
Ifve defeated Atlanta.
Letfs go see Chao for now. Fufufufufu.
So Chao and Atlanta were the same person..
I canft forgive her for deceiving my pure heart.
Shefs getting sexy punishment.
Hmmmmmmm.
Ifm just not in the mood to think.
ƒƒƒ LV 5F
„„„
Seems like the Helman losers used the keys they stole(??)
from me to start moving the Toushin Toshi. I dunno what
the hell theyfre up to, but I donft like it.
They should be in the control room, so this time for
sure, Ifll perform their last rites and make the Toushin
Toshi mine.
Heh heh heh, when I obtain this Toushin Toshi, Ifll be
able to rule the world, and the day when all the beauties
in the world are mine will be close.. What a wonderful
thing. Letfs get going.
That Upsilon bastardfs unbelievably strong.
Shit, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Hmmmm, well, Ifve defeated countless powerful enemies up
until now, so Ifm sure itfll be fine this time too.
Ifm sure Ifll find a way to defeat it.
....Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm.
hRance-sama, does your stomach hurt??h
hHeh?h
hYoufve been going fhmmm, hmmmf for a while now....
 Umm.. are you alright??h
hI donft have a fucking stomach ache!
 Ifm thinking!!h
hEh, ah.. Ifm sorry.
 But Ifm glad youfre alright.h
Tch, I was just about to come up with a brilliant plan to
kill Upsilon, but Sill interrupted me, so I lost my train
of thought... Shit.
hUmm....h
hWhat is it?h
hMaybe we should rõ the Œ¤‹†ŠjS or Supply
 Core...h
hWhy?h
hWell.. ‹x”Œ“Á-san and Dens-san could be there..?h
hThose Helman guys, huh.h
hTheir commander Bitch is dead now, so if we talk to
 them, Ifm sure theyfll join us.
 Theyfre good people.h
h......I donft want any dudes on my team.h
h..........h
•¤—¢ and ‹x”Œ“Á, two Helman men, have joined my party.
I didnft want to team up with filthy men, but Ifm sure
theyfve got some use as meat shields.
Ifll make them take Upsilonfs attacks, and while itfs
busy with them, Ifll defeat it with a Rance Attack.
Fufufufufu, what a perfect plan.
hGahahahahahaha, Ifm great, Ifm invincible!!
 Everyone, follow me, wefre gonna go beat Upsilon!!h
hRance-dono.h
hWhat, Mecha Geezer. You want something?h
hYou understand that destroying the Magic Columns must be
 prioritized before defeating Upsilon, yes?h
h.....Oh, right.
 Right, right, the Magic Columns, wefre destroying
 those.h
h.........h
hAre we really gonna be alright leaving this to him,
 Grandpa?h
h.....I must admit I am a bit worried.h
Phew, taking out those Magic Columns was tiring, even for
me.
Wefll fight Upsilon after resting a bit.
I canft belive Cynthia got abducted by monsters.. Shit,
it was a mistake to leave protecting the town to u—¥
and those incompetents.
Anyway, wefre fighting Upsilon.
And itfs the final battle, so I wonft be able to win
using auto battle. Ifve gotta direct everyone, yup.
hGahahahahahahahahahahaha..!h
h......h
This is bad, wefve gotta escape!
hRance-sama, the Landing Crafts are in the Tousho Core.h
hI know.
 Letfs hurry.h
ƒƒƒ LV 6F
„„„
Call what (whom)?
I wonft call anyone.
I changed my mind, I donft wanna call anyone.
....I donft need to call her now.
Alright, letfs squeeze some Devilfs Nectar out of Feliss.
hCome out, Feliss.h
hOh, yes.. Maste... kya!h
I pushed Feliss over as soon as she appeared.
hWh.. what are you..?h
hI need the love juice that comes out of your pussy!
 Ifm gonna squeeze out a bunch, okay?h
I stuck two fingers into Felissf pussy and stirred them
around.
hCfmon, youfre not getting wet at all.
 Put some effort into this.h
hOw.. well.. if youfre so violent.. of course I canft..!h
hStop nitpicking!
 This is an order from your master, so hurry up and get
 excited and wet!!h
hThatfs impossible!h
hI donft fuckinf care.
 Fine, then Ifll squeeze it outta you this way!h
I held Felissf ass in place and stuck my hyper weapon
deep into her vagina.
(Ram)
Feliss h*Ga..sp*....!h
Then, with a firm grasp on her breasts, I began raging,
hot, intense piston movement.
(Ram ram ram)
Feliss h*Gasp*.. *gasp*.. *gasp*..!h
(Ram ram ram ram ramramramramramram!)
Feliss hAh.. ah.. ah.. ahi..!h
Before the attacks of my hyper weapon, Felissf pussy
slowly became hotter and wetter.
Rance hThere, youfre wet now!
       There are no girls who wonft get wet from my
       *beeeeep*!
       Gahahahahahahahahaha!h
Feliss hOoh.. *gasp*.. *gasp*.. *gasp*..!h
The nectar is finally flowing freely now.
My hyper weapon finally discharges due to that nectar as
well as the cool, refreshing feeling of Felissf pussy.
Rance hOoh.. shit.. ooh!h
(Spuuuuurt, gush gush)
I unleashed the hot fluid of justice into the devil.
Rance hTch, damn.
       I meant to just get the nectar.h
I collected the nectar from Felissf twitching pussy.
Obtained Kind of Fishy-smelling Devilfs Nectar.
hAlright, well, itfs probably fine.
 You can go home now, Feliss.h
hOoh.. why is it always.. this..!?h
Feliss returned to the Devil Realm.
Alright, Ifm calling Feliss the devil.
hCome out, Feliss.h
An area of space seemed to vibrate for a second, and then
Feliss appeared.
h...Do you need something, Master?h
hOf course I need something, thatfs why I called you.h
hWell, the weather is very nice today.h
h........h
hAnd Ifm feeling very good too.
 Actually I feel a little too good, itfs kind of
 upsetting.h
h........h
hSo I thought maybe Ifd share some of my wonderful power
 with my subordinate Miss Feliss.h
h......Agaaain..?h
hAargh, shut up!
 Hurry up and strip!!h
I pushed Feliss down and tore off her clothes.
hKyaaaa!h
hGahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!
 Even though youfre a devil, Ifll send you straight to
 heaven!h
I thrust my destructive weapon, towering with the spirit
of passion, into Felissf meat sandwich.
(Ramramram.. ram!)
Feliss hHaaaaah... ahn..!h
Felissf vagina, a little colder than a human one, felt
cool and pleasant.
When I stirred around and started thrusting, Feliss
started shaking her hips and struggling.
Feliss hAaaaah... ahn...!h
hHowfs that.. Gahahahahahaha!
 You want me to thrust more, right?h
(Ram ram ram)
Feliss hAaaah.. ahn....!h
(Spuuuurt)
hMmm, Ifm satisfied.h
h.....Umm, Master..?
 What was it you called me for??h
hYoufve done it.
 You can go home now.h
h..........h
hIfll call you when I wanna fuck again, so keep yourself
 clean and ready for me, alright?
 Well, see ya.h
h.....Yes, sir.h
(Poof)
The air quivered for a second and Ferris returned to the
Devil Realm.
I just rested.
Whofd be stupid enough to rest twice in a row?
hRance-sama, we just rested.
 Our health and stamina are full.h
hSo?h
