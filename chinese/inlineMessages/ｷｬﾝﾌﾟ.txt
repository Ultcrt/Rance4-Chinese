I held the Return Bonsai in both of my hands.
I carefully spun it 2, 3 times.
Then finally a light shone out from the center of the
Return Bonsai.
ÅEÅEÅEÅEÅEÅEÅE(Return!!)ÅEÅEÅEÅEÅEÅEÅEÅE.
When I realized it, we had returned to the Tulip #4.
I held the Return Bonsai in both hands.

Looks like I canÅft use that here.
ÅhRance-sama, we canÅft use the

ÅhWhy? ThatÅfs unfair.
 I wanna use it and IÅfm important.Åh
ÅhBut.. I canÅft do anything about it.Åh
ÅhHmph, then IÅfll do this.Åh
I embraced Sill and fondled her breasts over her clothes
from behind.
(Fondle fondle fondle fondle)
ÅhOh.. Rance-sama, why are you doing this?Åh
(Fondle fondle fondle fondle)
(Grip)ÅÉÅ|Twist.
ÅhKyan!Åh
ÅhWell, IÅfll give up on trying to use the 
 with this.Åh
Åh..........Åh
ÅhRance-sama, weÅfve collected all of the A mirror
 fragments, so IÅfll put them together now.Åh
ÅhAlright, do it.Åh
The four fragments clinked as Sill put them together.
Rukira ÅhThank you very much.
        IÅfm Rukira from the bank.Åh
Rukira ÅhPlease accept 2,000 gold as thanks for saving
        me.Åh
Received 2,000 gold.
Rukira ÅhWell then, goodbye.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, weÅfve collected all of the B mirror
 fragments, so IÅfll put them together now.Åh
ÅhAlright, do it.Åh
The four fragments clinked as Sill put them together.
Ella ÅhIÅfm saved! IÅfm Ella from the weapon shop.
      I got caught by Atlanta!Åh
Åh........Heheh.Åh
Ella ÅhHey, stop looking like that.
      IÅfm embarrassed enough as it is.Åh
Ella ÅhAnyway, as thanks for saving me, IÅfll give you this
      Lightweight Bow.Åh
Received Lightweight Bow.
Ella ÅhWell then, see you.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, weÅfve collected all of the C mirror

Received Lionet.
ÅhRance-sama, weÅfve collected all of the D mirror

ÅhYup.Åh
Oichi ÅhAs thanks, IÅfll give you this Strength Spray.Åh

Oichi ÅhWell then, see you.Åh
Seems like I canÅft use that here.
ÅhRance-sama, we canÅft use the 
 here.Åh

Did not change equipment.
ÅhAthena canÅft change her Åfquipment.
 Oh noes.Åh
ÅhIÅfm happy with my current equipment.

I donÅft really need to think about anything right now.
The world moves according to my will whether or not I
think about it, so IÅfm sure everything will work out in
the end.
I AM the main character, and a hero after all!
My fateÅfs different than the average person who doesnÅft
know whatÅfll happen to them next.
Gahahahahahahaha!
First of all, IÅfve gotta kill that cocky hag (though IÅfm
not sure if Death will even take a bitch like her) and
take back Sill.
IÅfll do anything to accomplish that.
A hero such as myself shouldnÅft have to resort to acting
like a wannabe adventurer and bullying low-level monsters
for experience.. but.. IÅfve got no choice.
IÅfm gonna kill some small fry monsters and get some
experience points.
IÅfve come up with a goal for the time being.
Fucking that Mai girl.
This is a good goal.
IÅfm more motivated to accomplish a goal like fucking a
girl than a regular one like defeating evil monsters for
the sake of justice or sealing a terrible, destructive
Demon King. Yup.
Right, in order to fuck Mai, IÅfve gotta defeat the Okayu
Fever whoÅfs demanding sacrifices. Alright, letÅfs go.
Well, IÅfve exterminated the evil Okayu Fever demanding
beautiful girl sacrifices.
All thatÅfs left is...
Heehee.. fucking Mai.
IÅfve decided on my next goal.
IÅfll check out this Toushin Toshi thing and return to the
surface.
And IÅfll accomplish this by... Well, I dunno.
But IÅfm sure IÅfll find something if I investigate the
underground labyrinths.
ÅÉÅÉÅÉ LV1ÅF
 ÅÑÅÑÅÑ
The ghost girl Naturi who was in the dungeon.
IÅfve gotta save her and find the E Key...
ÅhSill.Åh
ÅhYes, Rance-sama?
 What is it?Åh
(Grab.. Fondle fondle)
I suddenly grabbed SillÅfs breasts and fondled them.
ÅhAhn...!Åh
ÅhYup, they still feel good.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, what was that for??Åh
ÅhI just did it Åfcause I wanted to.
 ThereÅfs no other reason.Åh
ÅhYour only reason for existing is to be there when I want
 some boobs to grab.
 ItÅfs just like having a lighter for when you want fire.Åh
Åh....Okay.Åh
IÅfve gotta obtain that key for Io.
I feel like I could do anything for her for some reason.
Io wants me to find four keys.
Well, thereÅfs nothing a genius adventurer like me
couldnÅft find.
I can see IoÅfs grateful face already!
.............
Åh.............Åh
ÅhIs something wrong, Rance-sama?Åh
(Pick pick)
IÅfm not really in the mood for thinking so I stuck a
finger in my nose and started picking it.
Åh....??Åh
I got a big fingerful of snot, so I quickly stuck my
finger into SillÅfs fluffy hair and wiped it off.
ÅhKyan!Åh
ÅhGahahahaha, my nose feels great!Åh
Well, IÅfve found the key to the reùrçı room, so I
should use it and thoroughly ùrçı the room.
I might find something, after all.
ÅhWeÅfre thoroughly ùrçıing the reùrçı room.
 Got it, Sill?Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
ÅhThere might be something in the back room where that
 Tousho was after all.Åh
.....Well, the ghost is resting in peace and IÅfve done a
good deed. IÅfm a shoo-in for heaven now.
Ah, there must be beauties waiting for me in heaven.
But... I canÅft die yet.
...Women women women women women.
ÅhRance-sama, are you thinking about what we should do
 next?Åh
ÅhOf course.Åh
Seems like the weird scientist Moganda has made a secret
reùrçı lab underground....
I bet heÅfs doing sexy reùrçı.
Capturing young girls... Ooh..!
ÅhWhat is it, Rance-sama?
 Is something the matter?Åh
ÅhShut up, donÅft interrupt my thoughts.Åh
(Smack, hit, kick)
Åh*So...b*Åh
LetÅfs find the E Key.
It should be somewhere around here.
LetÅfs just find fuckinÅf Moganda and kill Åfim.
ThatÅfs enough for now.
First of all, weÅfve got to explore Ylapu.
IÅfm sure Rance and Sill-chan are somewhere here.
LetÅfs do our best and ùrçı for them.
What a strange dungeon. ItÅfs full of fields.
I wonder if Rance and Sill-chan are really here?
And the Helman Army that just attacked us..
This bugs me. What could their objective be..?
Oh.. If the Helman Army is here, then I wonder if theyÅfve
also invented a flying machine? WhatÅfll I do if it works
better than my Tulip?
IÅfm surprised that Rick-san changes so much just from
losing his helmet.
I bet this is a Åhsplit personalityÅh thing.
Anyway, weÅfre gonna have a lot of problems if we donÅft
find his helmet and get him back to the strong Rick-san.
We donÅft know when the Helman Army will attack again.
The helmet probably fell somewhere in that aqueduct.
We should be able to find it if we look there.
ItÅfs good that we found his helmet and Rick-san is back
to his reliable self.
Looks like it would be good to explore the dungeon more
to find Rance.
....I wonder if Rance is really here.
IÅfm starting to worry...
The Helman ArmyÅfs probably gonna attack again..
Hmmmmm.
Rick and Julia from Leazas have joined my party.
Kanami, Leila, Maria, and Shizuka should also be here
somewhere.
First, letÅfs save them and claim, oh, 5 rounds or so of
sex as our reward.
They were lost in the Supply Core. Now, letÅfs go save
Åfem.
ÅhKanami, I went through all this trouble to save you, so
 you better be grateful forever, okay?Åh
Åh....Well, I guess I am a little...Åh
ÅhA little!? What the heckÅfs Åfa littleÅf to the man who
 saved your life!?
 Why donÅft you say something like ÅfIÅfll serve you for the
 rest of my life with my body!Åf?Åh
ÅhWhy on earth would I say something like that, loser?Åh
ÅhYou ungrateful bitch.Åh
Merim, the Helman soldier, has suddenly become an ally.
I donÅft even have to make an effort and girls just flock
to my beauty. Must be my natural talent.
Anyway, this Merim girl could be useful at some point, so
I should probably have her join the party.
Those Helman bastards have added a pretty powerful
comrade to their ranks.
What fuckinÅf cheaters.
I want a powerful subordinate whoÅfll do anything I say.
A beautiful, glamorous one of course...
SillÅfs weak, so I donÅft need Åfer.
Anyway, itÅfd be dangerous to fight that Dio Tousho.
We should think of another way to proceed.
.........Hmmm.
I canÅft think of anything.
WeÅfve beaten the Octomen, so it looks like weÅfve got
quite a shortcut now.
The Helman losers are still held up there, so I should
take this opportunity to grab the keys.
Looks like the dragon on the lowest floor of the Defense
Core has the key. IÅfm sure itÅfd be easy to kill it and
take the key, but a dragon might be a little dangerous.
Well, IÅfve gotta find the DragonÅfs Cold Medicine he
requested if I want to proceed. Tch, this is pissing me
off. I canÅft believe I have to stoop to this....
Anyway, the Cold Medicine should be in the biggest tower,
the ÅhBuoyancy Staff.Åh
I guess IÅfll go there.
IÅfve obtained the DragonÅfs Cold Medicine.
Now all IÅfve gotta do is get back to the dragon.
ÅÉÅÉÅÉ LV 4ÅF
ÅÑÅÑÅÑ
IÅfve obtained the S Key.
The last key is the N Key in the Tousho Core.
IÅfll definitely find it.
But the warp point to the Tousho Core is broken and
doesnÅft work.. This is a problem.
ÅhSill.Åh
ÅhYes, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhI will specially accept any proposals you have as to our
 next course of action, so spill.Åh
ÅhWell, out of the four keys required to move this Toushin
 Toshi, Rance-sama has the S Key and the Helman Army has
 the W Key and the E Key.Åh
ÅhI think we should prioritize obtaining the final N Key.Åh
ÅhWell, of course, but to get to the Tousho Core....Åh
ÅhYes, we canÅft get there because the warp device is
 broken.
 I think weÅfll have to look for another passageway.Åh
ÅhIÅfm not sure, but maybe we should start by investigating
 the passageway going down from the power room?Åh
ÅhDown, huh.....?Åh
ÅhYes, we might be able to get through there.Åh
ÅhHmmm.Åh
First I should collect all of these ãæîV·Íï–s.
What troublesome women.
If they were dudes I woulda given up on Åfem waaaay
earlier.
ÅhRance-sama, what if I got stuck in a mirror?Åh
ÅhWhat do you mean Åfwhat ifÅf?Åh
ÅhWould you try to find me?Åh
Åh........Åh
ÅhNope.
 IÅfd abandon you.Åh
Åh*Sob* *sob*.Åh
IÅfve collected Leila and KanamiÅfs ãæîV·Íï–s.
Geez, that was annoying.
Well, should I go see Chao now?
Chao said Atlants would be on the fifth underground
floor.
IÅfll go crush her.
IÅfve defeated Atlanta.
LetÅfs go see Chao for now. Fufufufufu.
So Chao and Atlanta were the same person..
I canÅft forgive her for deceiving my pure heart.
SheÅfs getting sexy punishment.
Hmmmmmmm.
IÅfm just not in the mood to think.
ÅÉÅÉÅÉ LV 5ÅF
ÅÑÅÑÅÑ
Seems like the Helman losers used the keys they stole(??)
from me to start moving the Toushin Toshi. I dunno what
the hell theyÅfre up to, but I donÅft like it.
They should be in the control room, so this time for
sure, IÅfll perform their last rites and make the Toushin
Toshi mine.
Heh heh heh, when I obtain this Toushin Toshi, IÅfll be
able to rule the world, and the day when all the beauties
in the world are mine will be close.. What a wonderful
thing. LetÅfs get going.
That Upsilon bastardÅfs unbelievably strong.
Shit, what the hell am I supposed to do?
Hmmmm, well, IÅfve defeated countless powerful enemies up
until now, so IÅfm sure itÅfll be fine this time too.
IÅfm sure IÅfll find a way to defeat it.
....Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm.
ÅhRance-sama, does your stomach hurt??Åh
ÅhHeh?Åh
ÅhYouÅfve been going Åfhmmm, hmmmÅf for a while now....
 Umm.. are you alright??Åh
ÅhI donÅft have a fucking stomach ache!
 IÅfm thinking!!Åh
ÅhEh, ah.. IÅfm sorry.
 But IÅfm glad youÅfre alright.Åh
Tch, I was just about to come up with a brilliant plan to
kill Upsilon, but Sill interrupted me, so I lost my train
of thought... Shit.
ÅhUmm....Åh
ÅhWhat is it?Åh
ÅhMaybe we should ùrçı the Reùrçı Core or Supply
 Core...Åh
ÅhWhy?Åh
ÅhWell.. Hubert-san and Dens-san could be there..?Åh
ÅhThose Helman guys, huh.Åh
ÅhTheir commander Bitch is dead now, so if we talk to
 them, IÅfm sure theyÅfll join us.
 TheyÅfre good people.Åh
Åh......I donÅft want any dudes on my team.Åh
Åh..........Åh
Freak and Hubert, two Helman men, have joined my party.
I didnÅft want to team up with filthy men, but IÅfm sure
theyÅfve got some use as meat shields.
IÅfll make them take UpsilonÅfs attacks, and while itÅfs
busy with them, IÅfll defeat it with a Rance Attack.
Fufufufufu, what a perfect plan.
ÅhGahahahahahaha, IÅfm great, IÅfm invincible!!
 Everyone, follow me, weÅfre gonna go beat Upsilon!!Åh
ÅhRance-dono.Åh
ÅhWhat, Mecha Geezer. You want something?Åh
ÅhYou understand that destroying the Magic Columns must be
 prioritized before defeating Upsilon, yes?Åh
Åh.....Oh, right.
 Right, right, the Magic Columns, weÅfre destroying
 those.Åh
Åh.........Åh
ÅhAre we really gonna be alright leaving this to him,
 Grandpa?Åh
Åh.....I must admit I am a bit worried.Åh
Phew, taking out those Magic Columns was tiring, even for
me.
WeÅfll fight Upsilon after resting a bit.
I canÅft belive Cynthia got abducted by monsters.. Shit,
it was a mistake to leave protecting the town to Shizuka
and those incompetents.
Anyway, weÅfre fighting Upsilon.
And itÅfs the final battle, so I wonÅft be able to win
using auto battle. IÅfve gotta direct everyone, yup.
ÅhGahahahahahahahahahahaha..!Åh
Åh......Åh
This is bad, weÅfve gotta escape!
ÅhRance-sama, the Landing Crafts are in the Tousho Core.Åh
ÅhI know.
 LetÅfs hurry.Åh
ÅÉÅÉÅÉ LV 6ÅF
ÅÑÅÑÅÑ
Call what (whom)?
I wonÅft call anyone.
I changed my mind, I donÅft wanna call anyone.
....I donÅft need to call her now.
Alright, letÅfs squeeze some DevilÅfs Nectar out of Feliss.
ÅhCome out, Feliss.Åh
ÅhOh, yes.. Maste... kya!Åh
I pushed Feliss over as soon as she appeared.
ÅhWh.. what are you..?Åh
ÅhI need the love juice that comes out of your pussy!
 IÅfm gonna squeeze out a bunch, okay?Åh
I stuck two fingers into FelissÅf pussy and stirred them
around.
ÅhCÅfmon, youÅfre not getting wet at all.
 Put some effort into this.Åh
ÅhOw.. well.. if youÅfre so violent.. of course I canÅft..!Åh
ÅhStop nitpicking!
 This is an order from your master, so hurry up and get
 excited and wet!!Åh
ÅhThatÅfs impossible!Åh
ÅhI donÅft fuckinÅf care.
 Fine, then IÅfll squeeze it outta you this way!Åh
I held FelissÅf ass in place and stuck my hyper weapon
deep into her vagina.
(Ram)
Feliss Åh*Ga..sp*....!Åh
Then, with a firm grasp on her breasts, I began raging,
hot, intense piston movement.
(Ram ram ram)
Feliss Åh*Gasp*.. *gasp*.. *gasp*..!Åh
(Ram ram ram ram ramramramramramram!)
Feliss ÅhAh.. ah.. ah.. ahi..!Åh
Before the attacks of my hyper weapon, FelissÅf pussy
slowly became hotter and wetter.
Rance ÅhThere, youÅfre wet now!
       There are no girls who wonÅft get wet from my
       *beeeeep*!
       Gahahahahahahahahaha!Åh
Feliss ÅhOoh.. *gasp*.. *gasp*.. *gasp*..!Åh
The nectar is finally flowing freely now.
My hyper weapon finally discharges due to that nectar as
well as the cool, refreshing feeling of FelissÅf pussy.
Rance ÅhOoh.. shit.. ooh!Åh
(Spuuuuurt, gush gush)
I unleashed the hot fluid of justice into the devil.
Rance ÅhTch, damn.
       I meant to just get the nectar.Åh
I collected the nectar from FelissÅf twitching pussy.
Obtained Kind of Fishy-smelling DevilÅfs Nectar.
ÅhAlright, well, itÅfs probably fine.
 You can go home now, Feliss.Åh
ÅhOoh.. why is it always.. this..!?Åh
Feliss returned to the Devil Realm.
Alright, IÅfm calling Feliss the devil.
ÅhCome out, Feliss.Åh
An area of space seemed to vibrate for a second, and then
Feliss appeared.
Åh...Do you need something, Master?Åh
ÅhOf course I need something, thatÅfs why I called you.Åh
ÅhWell, the weather is very nice today.Åh
Åh........Åh
ÅhAnd IÅfm feeling very good too.
 Actually I feel a little too good, itÅfs kind of
 upsetting.Åh
Åh........Åh
ÅhSo I thought maybe IÅfd share some of my wonderful power
 with my subordinate Miss Feliss.Åh
Åh......Agaaain..?Åh
ÅhAargh, shut up!
 Hurry up and strip!!Åh
I pushed Feliss down and tore off her clothes.
ÅhKyaaaa!Åh
ÅhGahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!
 Even though youÅfre a devil, IÅfll send you straight to
 heaven!Åh
I thrust my destructive weapon, towering with the spirit
of passion, into FelissÅf meat sandwich.
(Ramramram.. ram!)
Feliss ÅhHaaaaah... ahn..!Åh
FelissÅf vagina, a little colder than a human one, felt
cool and pleasant.
When I stirred around and started thrusting, Feliss
started shaking her hips and struggling.
Feliss ÅhAaaaah... ahn...!Åh
ÅhHowÅfs that.. Gahahahahahaha!
 You want me to thrust more, right?Åh
(Ram ram ram)
Feliss ÅhAaaah.. ahn....!Åh
(Spuuuurt)
ÅhMmm, IÅfm satisfied.Åh
Åh.....Umm, Master..?
 What was it you called me for??Åh
ÅhYouÅfve done it.
 You can go home now.Åh
Åh..........Åh
ÅhIÅfll call you when I wanna fuck again, so keep yourself
 clean and ready for me, alright?
 Well, see ya.Åh
Åh.....Yes, sir.Åh
(Poof)
The air quivered for a second and Ferris returned to the
Devil Realm.
I just rested.
WhoÅfd be stupid enough to rest twice in a row?
ÅhRance-sama, we just rested.
 Our health and stamina are full.Åh
ÅhSo?Åh
ÅhSo.. well...Åh
ÅhWhat is it? Speak clearly.Åh
ÅhWell.. I mean, resting again would just be a waste of
 time.. or something...Åh
ÅhShut up, IÅfll be the one to decide whether or not itÅfs a
 waste. DonÅft talk back to me.Åh
ÅhAh.. yes.
 Then are we resting again?Åh
ÅhNo, thatÅfd be pointless.Åh
Alright, IÅfm taking a break.
I took a break and spaaaaced out.
 *Spaaaaaace*.
    *Spaaaaaace*.
          *Spaaaaace.*
 *Spaaaaace*.
Health and stamina recovered.
ÅhAlright, weÅfre taking a short break.Åh
ÅhYes, Rance-sama.Åh
We took a one-hour break.
Our health and stamina fully recovered because we rested.
We just rested a little while ago.
ÅhLetÅfs take a little break.Åh
ÅhYes, letÅfs do that.Åh
ÅhYaaay, a break, a break!Åh
We took an hour-long break.
Our health and stamina fully recovered because we rested.
âcín will close.
IÅfm going to fly a Type 100 Spy Plane.
Takeoff.... *Whiiiir*.
Scouting mission complete, now returning.
Io asks Rance, ÅhI want to.. tease your devil. Can I?Åh
Sure.
Io ties Feliss up and sprinkles holy water onto her.
The holy water releases intense steam, burning FelissÅf
skin.
Rance intervenes as itÅfs just too cruel.
ThatÅfs enough. Quit it.
Feliss, you can go home now.
