hLetfs see??h
hAlright, letfs go!h
hYes.h
We stood in the center of the magic circle on the ground.
Doesnft look like therefs any reason to search thoroughly
here.
(Rattle rattle rattle rattle)
A dry sound echoed from somewhere.
... hYou are entering a place of rest for the dead.
     The living do not belong here.h
... hProceeding means certain death.h
hIt sounds like a warning, Rance-sama.
 Maybe we should turn back...h
h.....I guess.
 Itfs not like Ifd get scared of a stupid warning like
 that though.
 Wefll just turn back for now.h
hYes, Rance-sama.h
We turned around.

(Bam bam bam)
”œŠ±’B was too scared of me to come out.
hRance-sama...h
hThere he is! itfs ”œŠ±’B!
 What the heckfs he doing?h
hResearch, research, research again today!
 How great am I for being so passionate about my
 research?h
hThose rock-headed, old-fashioned researchers are just
 jealous of my brilliant new ideas and thatfs why they
 keep getting in my way!
 What fools.h
hWell then, what kind of Tousho should I develop
 today..?h
hThis is.. a 50-year-old KyanKyan.
 KyanKyan just donft make great materials.h
hThis onefs a 15-year-old Pressure Master. Theyfve
 got great stamina and fighting ability, but Ifm kind of
 tired of making them into Tousho, unfortunately.h
hThis is... a human?
 Humans are just too weak to make good Tousho.h
hTheyfre such wasteful creatures.
 I canft use this.h
h...Wait.
 Itfs true that normal researchers canft make good human
 Tousho, but Ifm a genius, so I should be able to.h
hA 200-year-old human, huh? Alright, Ifll take it.
 Ifll use a human for the first time in a while!h
Laughing like an idiot, ”œŠ±’B took a flask out of his
pocket, opened it up, and and sprinkled its contents onto
the statue.
(Sizzle, sizzle)
hCarry this to my Research Room.h
So this is where that nut keeps his research materials,
eh..?
Thatfs pretty creepy.
hWhat should we do, Rance-sama?h
hKill fim, of course.h
hTherefs nothing wrong with killing evil mad scientists.h
h”œŠ±’B..?h
hHe ran away.
 But we know where he is this time.h

.. hMommy said not to let strangers into the house.h
hRance-sama, it doesnft look like wefll be able to get

hHmm, wanting to enter even more after being told you

 Letfs think of a way.h
(Knock knock)

hItfs Mommy. Open the door.h
.. hNo way, Mommyfs voice isnft that scary!h
hRance-sama, I donft think thatfs going to work.h

(Click)
Tokko-chan hWelcome home, Momm.. kya!!h

The Tokko-chan ran back into the room.
But now that the door is open, Ifve won.
A strange creature appeared.
hI am the genius scientist!!
 My brainfs the best in the world, Ifm so cool!
 Ifm super, Ifm great, Ifm efficient, Ifm the president,
 Ifm rich! My name is Genius ”œŠ±’B!h
hHey, weirdo.

hYeah, get out of our way!h
hWh... what could this mean!?h
hWhat is it, geezer?h
hHumans for my experiments are wandering around here?
 What on earth are my wardens doing!?
 Pay cuts, pay cuts, pay cuts!h
h....Whatfs this weirdo saying?h
hWho knows. Maybe hefs not all there, you know?
 They say there are more people like this when it starts
 to get warm out, you know?h
hI see, then it shouldnft be a problem if we kill him.h
hWhy not?
 I donft think anyone would care.h
h125+38=46!
 Uhaha, uhaha, Ifm perfect today too!h
hWell then, Ifll defeat these escapees with my newly
 developed Tousho!
 Uhaha, uhaha, uhaha!h
hGo, my Tousho!
 Show me your invincible power!h
hPhew, flawless victory, eh?h
hI suppose so. Oh?
 Where did that crazy guy with the weird head go?h
hI guess hefs not here anymore.
 Sill, fd you see him?h
hUmm, that strange robot man?
 He ran away right when the battle started.h
hWhat, Sill!?
 And you just let him go?!h
hEh? Rance-sama.. thatfs not it..
 You didnft say anything about chasing him either.h
hShut up! Ifm gonna be pissed if that weirdo shows up
 again. You shoulda just killed him, you idiot!h
hWait, Rance-san.
 I donft think Sill-chan meant any harm.h
h...Well, if you say so, ˆÉ‰œ...h
hˆÉ‰œ-san...h
hBut mistakes are mistakes!
 Slaves have to remember mistakes with their bodies.
 But donft you worry about it, Rance-san. Ifll punish her
 for you.h
ˆÉ‰œ took out a black whip and beat Sill with it.
(Whoooooosh thwack)
h*Gasp*..!h
hItfs not over yet! Take that!h
(Smack
 smack
 smack
 smack)
Sillfs white skin received a harsh whip baptism and
swelled up, turning red.
h*Gasp*.. *gasp*.. *sob* *sob*.h
hFufufufu, how pathetic.
 Hoooohohohohohohoho!h
hRance-sama, please come back to your senses!
 ˆÉ‰œ-san has cast a Charm spell on you, Rance-sama!h
Sill clung to me and said some weird stuff, but I kicked
her away. Shefs got such an attitude for a slave.
hDonft talk nonsense, Sill. Youfre just a slave.h
hRance-sama...!h
Sailor hMaking a frail girl cry, Rance?
        Your evil deeds end here!h
hWho the hell are you??h
Sailor hTherefs no point in talking!
        Die!h
hGahahahaha, Ifm gonna make you cry instead!h
Blazer hOh, Sailor.. You lost, I see.
        You have so much energy and you canft do anything

h...Are you gonna fight me too?
 Or are you a young girl in love whofs come to be fucked
 by me?h
hThatfs it! That must be it!
 Hurry up and strip! Ifll fuck you!h
Blazer hWhat a selfish person, just like the rumors say.
        Looks like Ifll have to deal with you.h
Blazer hIfll cut that *beep* of yours right off so that
        you canft use it to pick on girls anymore.h
hUgh.. What a vulgar thing to say with a refined face.h
Blazer hNow, prepare yourself.h
Jumper hWaah, waah, waah!h

Jumper hWaah, waah, waah!h
hHm..? What the hell are you crying about, girl?h
Jumper hWaah.. *sniff*.. *sniff*.h

Jumper hWell.. I have a mission.. *sniffle*.

Jumper hKilling Rance...h

Jumpter hLiar.h
hThatfs hardly fair!h
Jumper hFine. If you wonft do it, then I will.
        Taaaah!h
The Jumper attacked.
h*Cough*.. *cough*.. that poisonous gas is still here.h
hRance-san.h
hI got it. *Cough*.
 Fuckinf poison gas! Your evil deeds end here!
 Ifm gonna erase you!h
h*Cough*, Rance-sama.. hurry!h
I took the ‰ğ“Å‹Ê out and smashed it on the
ground.
(Smaaash waft waft)
The ‰ğ“Å‹Ê broke into dust.
h.......h
h.......h
h........h
h....Nothingfs happening!
 Fucking ‰ğ“Å‹Ê, youfre a fucking liar!!h
h..No, Rance-sama.
 Itfs gradual, but the poisonous gas is disappearing.h

After a little while, the poisonous gas had completely
disappeared.

h*Cough*.. This is...h
h*Cough*.. Rance-sama, itfs poisonous gas!
 Letfs get away!h

We ran from the area with the poisonous gas.
h*Cough*.. *cough*...h
hRance-san, itfs poisonous gas!
 We have to turn back!h
h*Cough*.. I guess so.h
We ran from the area with the poisonous gas.
”œŠ±’B appeared with a few of his underlings in tow.
hI am the genius scientist!!
 My brainfs the best in the world, Ifm so cool!
 Ifm super, Ifm great, Ifm efficient, Ifm the president,
 Ifm rich! My name is Genius ”œŠ±’B!h
hHe showed up again.h
hHand over the “Œ•”èoú! You have it, donft you?h
hAccording to last weekfs theory, I should be better, but
 according to this weekfs theory, I should be a home run!
 How very difficult.h
hHey, crazy!
 Did you not hear us tell you to hand over the “Œ•”èoú?h
hLast monthfs research costs meant I had to cut back on
 my food budget. That wasnft good.
 I want to eat hamburger.h
h...Hefs insane. Nothing we can say will get through to
 him.h
hOh, over there, could that be... hu-mans!

hGo! Destroy those humans!h
Mecha Kol hNiihaao!h
hAnd ”œŠ±’B...?h
hIt looks like he got away, Rance-sama.h
hSill, you let him get away again?h
hBut, I... I tried my best!h
hThe problem isnft how hard you tried.
 The problem is your results. Results, got it?
 Time for some punishment!h
hYeah, slaves should be punished when they make mistakes.
 What would be good?h
hGot any good ideas, ˆÉ‰œ?h
hLetfs see.h
hWhat about masturbating here?h
hEh...?h
hI see. That sounds interesting.
 Do it, Sill.h
hRance-sama, do I really have to..?h
hSill-chan, if you donft hurry up and do it, a monster
 might show up.h
hDo it.
 If you stop before you cum, Ifll never forgive you.h
When I glared at her, Sill gave up and started taking off
her clothes.
hYes....h
Sill started awkwardly touching her breasts and pussy.
hAh...!h
hAlright, keep it up.h
hOh, monsters!h
hEh? Eh? Nooo.. ahn!h
Sill panicked and tried to get her clothes back on but
ended up tripping and falling over instead.
hI lied. You got all panicked! How embarrassing.h
hYoufre terrible....h
h*Spin* *spin* *spin* *spin*.h
hRance-sama, everythingfs *spin* *spin* *spin*ning!h
hWefve warped out.h
hAlright, that keyfs gotta be in here somewhere, right?h
hThatfs right, Rance-san.
