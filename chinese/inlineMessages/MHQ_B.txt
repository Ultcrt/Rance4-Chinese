 There are stairs leading up.
 There are stairs leading down.
 Therefs a transport device.
 Therefs a sign.
Alright, Ifm gonna look for monsters.
(Look look look)
Unfortunately, I couldnft find any monsters.

The door wonft open.

Ascend stairs?
Ascending to higher floor.
Descend stairs?
Descending to lower floor.
Doesnft look like therefs any reason to search thoroughly
here.
hBiiiiiiiitch, I know youfre hiding.. Huh, hefs not
 here?h
hWho are.. you...?h
hKya.. —–z-sama, look!h
Bitchfs corpse, smashed against the wall, was in the
direction Šó˜I pointed.
hKyaaaaaaa!!h
hWhat the... What the hell happened here?h
Upsilon hHumans, my enemies.
         I will obey my orders and kill you.h
hWhat the heckfs this thing..?
 Did you kill Bitch?h
Upsilon hMy name is Upsilon.
         The Holy Magic Sectfs 20th Toushin, Upsilon.h
hWow, a legendary Toushin!
 I canft believe Ifm actually seeing one!h
h.........h
hToushin Upsilon my ass.
 What are you planning?h
Upsilon hMy mission is the eradication of humanity and
         the Dark Lords.h
hRidiculous....h
Upsilon hI will destroy all of humanity.
         As M. M. Rune-sama has ordered.h
hShit, is he serious?
 That Tousho, Dio, was strong too, but this guy is
 clearly gonna be a bigger problem.h
hYes, hefs amazingly strong.h
hMerim, do you know anything about him?h
hY-yes, but for a Toushin to still be functioning... itfs
 like a dream.h
hToushin Upsilon is the center, no, you could say hefs
 the entirety of this Toushin Toshi.
 The Tousho are merely guards of the Toushin.h
hThat Dio was just a guard...?h
hYes, the Holy Magic Sectfs trump card against the Dark
 Lords was the Toushin, the invincible giant who could
 fight on equal ground with a Dark Lord.h
h—–z-sama, we canft win against that!h
hThe word fcanftf doesnft exist in my dictionary!
 But... for now, letfs retreat.h
h......h
hHero —–z-dono, maybe we should wait just a bit
 longer.h
hWhy?h
hWefve destroyed all of Upsilonfs energy supply, but he
 has internal reserves, so he still has some energy.h
hHrm.h
hTherefs no need to rush.
 Letfs wait a bit longer.h
hI guess so.h
Well.. I guess we can wait a little longer.
Hefs a pretty strong enemy. Itfll be easier to beat him
after weakening him a bit more.
Wefll go back to town and rest a bit first.
Before fighting the final enemy, I should do some fun
stuff and get recharged.
h—–z-sama, Toushin Upsilon is in here.h
h..........h
h—–z-sama, we should retreat for now....h
hWell, I donft have any issues with fighting him, but if
 Šó˜Ifs scared, I guess wefll have to call it off.
 Youfd better be grateful.h
hOh, yes.h
hAlright, letfs take care of some business.h
hYes, —–z-sama.h
(Ring ring riiing)
Suddenly Level God Willis and Apprentice Mikan appeared.
Willis hItfs time for the final battle, isnft it,
        —–z-san?h
Mikan hDo your best!h
hSo whatfs up?
 Here to give me a powerful item?h
Willis hWe came to warn you.
        Therefs no turning back after this point.h
Willis hIf youfd like to level up or have anything you
        still wanted to do, you should probably save
        here.h
Mikan hThen do your beeest!h
Willis disappeared.
h—–z-sama, are we really going in?
 Donft you think we should ‰c’n for a bit first??h
hThere she is! Itfs Cynthia!h
hRance-dono, hefs taking energy from Cynthia-dono through
 that sphere.h
hHmph, how underhanded.
 Wefll kick his ass with my glorious Rance Army!h
hYes, letfs do our best!h
h.....Who the hellfs Rancefs Army?h
Rance hAlright, Feliss!!
       Hurry up and come out!h
Feliss hOh, yes?
        Master, do you need something?h
Rance hOf course I do! Why would I call you if I didnft
       need you for something!?
       Okay, listen closely.h
Rance hYoufre going to save that girl, Cynthia, and then
       fly away somewhere. Yeah, like back to town.h
Feliss h...Is that it?h
Rance hYeah, hurry up and do it.h
Feliss hYes, sir.h
Feliss backed away from me and then teleported over to
Cynthia.
Feliss hThis girl, right?
        Geez, you give me the strangest orders.h
Feliss destroyed the sphere trapping Cynthia.
Cynthia fell, limp, into Felissf arms.
Feliss hOh, shefs pretty cute.h
Upsilon h...What!!?h
Rance hAlright, good job, Feliss!
       Get back to town!h
Feliss hYes, sir.h
Feliss disappeared, still holding Cynthia.
Rance hGahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
       I bet youfre feeling a little low on energy now!h
Upsilon h........h
hWhy donft you just starve to death from energy
 shortage!h
hWefll be back when youfre weak to put an end to you!h
Upsilon h......h
Upsilon glared at me, but I ignored him and took out a
Return Bonsai, preparing to retreat.
hWell then, see you.h
Upsilon hWait, I wonft let you get away!h
hIfm not gonna wait, you loser!h
I spun the Return Bonsai around and the scenery around me
started to blur. The transfer is starting.
Upsilon hSuper Tiger!h
hGahahahahaha, too late!h
The moment the magic hit, we teleported.
............
............
One girl remained after Rancefs party teleported away.
Šó˜I hRance-samaaa!! ..Donft leave me..!h
Upsilon h.........h
hPhew, looks like we made it back to town.
 Šó˜I, Ifm tired, so gimme a foot rub.h
h.............h
hHey Šó˜I, what are you doing? I gave you an order.
 Šó˜I... Hm..?h
I looked all around me and realized that Šó˜I was gone.
hHey, Kanami?
 You seen Šó˜I?h
hWasnft she with us...?
 Eh? Shefs not here??h
h...........h
hRance, where is she??h
hShefs not here... It couldnft be.....h
hIt looks like it could..
 That last attack from Upsilon...h
hShit, Šó˜I...!
 Wefre going back!h
hRance-dono, please calm down!h
hShut up. Šó˜Ifs mine.
 I wonft give her to that mechanical bastard!h
hAnyway, wefre taking Šó˜I back!
 He should be weaker now!h
hThatfs not necessarily the case, Rance-dono.
 Šó˜I-dono is a mage. She may have become Upsilonfs new
 energy source just like Cynthia-dono.h
hAgain? This is so annoying!h
hTh- that bastaaard!
 Every drop of Šó˜Ifs energy is mine!h
hAnyway, wefre leaving.h
When I started heading toward the dungeon, Maria appeared
in front of me.
hWhat do you want, Maria?
 Ifm in a hurry. Ifve got no time to fuck you.h
hThatfs not what I want, idiot.
 Youfre going to save Šó˜I-chan, right?h
h...Ifm just going to take back whatfs mine.h
h.....Itfs the same thing, isnft it?
 Anyway, Ifm going with you.h
hHmph, do whatever you want.h
hIf everyonefs going, Juliafs going too!
 Ifm gonna work hard!h
Maria and Julia joined the party.
We entered the dungeon again.
This time, wefll settle things for good.
(Beeeep beeeep beeeep)
System hHello, Rance-san.h
hWhat do you want? Ifm busy.h
System hHeading to the final battle, I see.
        Please just save to be careful, okay?h
hTch, donft worry about me...h
System hWell then, Ifll restore your HP as a special
        service.
        Goodbye.h
hHere we go.h
hAlways so busy.h
hWefre using the transport device.h
(Vwiiiin)
(Vwiiiin)
hToo slow, way too fucking slow!!
 Hurry it up!h
hAlright, wefre almost there.h
hHuff, huff, Juliafs tired from all the running!h
hRance, someonefs there!h
hHeh heh heh, looks like youfre all here.
 What a perfect opportunity to get rid of you all at
 once.h
hDio, huh...?h
Tch, wefre in a hurry and herefs a huge problem!
Wefve got no time to fight this guy!
hShit, wefre in a hurry here.....!h
hRance-dono, please leave this to me.h
hIfve got some business to settle with Dio, so Ifll take
 care of him.
 Please go on ahead, Rance-dono...h
hI see, youfre pretty thoughtful, mecha geezer.
 Ifll leave the small fry to you then.h
We left •¤—¢ behind and kept running.
hHeh heh, running away, eh?
 All they ever do is run.
 Do they really think they can escape me?h
hWait, Dio Calmis.
 I will be your opponent.h
h...A senile old fool, eh?
 You really want to die that bad?h
hI do not, but.. I must take revenge for Misly.h
hOh, that female Tousho? You knew her?
 Then Ifll send you two down to the same hell together!h
hTwo? What...?h
hGrandpa, Ifll fight too.h
hYou didnft go with Rance-dono, son of Toma!?
 Why are you here..?h
hI donft want to be anywhere near that idiot.h
h.........h
hYou canft win alone, Grandpa.
 Ifll help you out.h
hYou fool, youfll die.. Get away!!h
hIfm telling you not to push yourself so hard, old man.h
hYou two done talking?
 I think itfs about time you died.h
hYoufre the one whofs gonna die!h

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
hAlright, just a bit more.
 Just wait, Upsilon!h
hRance, enemies!h
(Rustle rustle rustle rustle)
Monsters shuffled out into the passageway loud enough
that I could sense them without Kanamifs help.
hTch.h
hThere are a lot of them! How many are there!?h
hTheyfre everywhere!!
 Ifm in a fucking hurry here!h
hRance-kun, leave this to us.h
hHurry and go to Šó˜I-san, Rance-dono...
 Wefll hold back the small fry here.h
hAlright, donft let fem get near me until I beat the shit
 out of Upsilon.h
hIf Captain åQffs staying, then Juliafs staying too!
 Bye-bye!h
hThen Rance... Ifll stay here too.
 Go.. save Šó˜I-chan.h
hHmph.h
I left the small fry to —¢ and them and hurried on.
hOkay, youfre not getting past here!h
hAlright, wefre goinf in!h
hYeah.h
h...I donft want to die.h
hOh, God....h
hRance, letfs do our best and save Šó˜I-chan!h
hOf course!
 Donft you guys die now. I donft wanna deal with it.h
............
h.....There she is!!h
I discovered Upsilon and Šó˜I, who was trapped in the
same kind of sphere Cynthia was, behind him.
hŠó˜I!!h
h..Ra.. Rance-samaaaa!!h
hHefs recovering by using Šó˜I-chan as his energy
 source!h
hYou bastard, how dare you use one of my women!?h
Upsilon h.......h
hYou listening? Ifm gonna crush you into such fine powder
 that a scrap metal shop wouldnft even look at you.h
hRance, donft get too excited and lose your composure for
 this fight.h
hShut up! Ifm always composed!
 Now letfs go!!h

hR-ridiculous... None of my magic affects him....h
hHeheheh, to think youfd challenge me with that level of
 skill..
 Youfre just trash who doesnft know its limits.h

hPull yourself together, ‹x”Œ“Á!
 Tomafs laughing on the other side!h
"Youfre the one whofs so beat up he can barely move,
 Grandpa!h
hActing tough in the face of death, huh...?
 Heheheh, killingfs the best. Therefs nothing better than
 this, heheheheh!h
hShit, you monster...!h

hYoufre pretty well prepared, Grandpa.
 I think a little better of you now.h
Hunty hNowfs not the time to take it easy like this!
       You guys woulda been toast if I hadnft shown up.h
hKuh, what is this ridiculous...?h
Hunty h! ....h
h..A Kalar, huh..? I might be able to have some fun, but,
 heheheh, youfre no match for me...
 The situation hasnft changed at all. My collection has

hHunty, magic doesnft work on him.

Šó˜I h...AAAAAaaaah....!h
Upsilon drained energy from Šó˜I and recovered 2,000 HP.
Rance hShit...!h
Upsilon hItfs no use.
         Humans cannot defeat me.h
Rance h........h
Rance hShut up, shut up, shut up, shut up!!h
Upsilon h......h
Rance hI canft lose!!
       Die!!h
Šó˜I hRance-sama...!h
Šó˜I hRance-sama canft win while Ifm being used as
      Upsilonfs energy...h
Šó˜I hAt this rate, Rance-sama will be killed...h
Šó˜I h......As long as Ifm here.....h
Šó˜I h...Rance-sama...h
Šó˜I appears to be trying to do something within the
sphere.
Rance hHey, Šó˜I!
       What are you doing!!?h
Šó˜I hRance-samaaa......!!h
Šó˜I hFire Laser!!h
Šó˜Ifs magic exploded inside the sphere, and Sill
collapsed with the explosion.
Rance hSill!!h
Upsilon hGuh... Impossible.. What did you.. No!h
Rance hSill, Sill, idiot!!
       Whatfd you do that for!!?h
Upsilon hGuh.. my power.. you..!h
Rance hSill.... Shit, Upsilon, Ifm gonna kill you!h
h.......Sill.h
hYou idiot.. Without my permission...h
hRance....h
hSill-chan.. This canft be...h
(Sway sway sway)
The Toushin Toshi began to shake wildly.
hRance, itfs.. dangerous here.
 We have to run or itfll collpase.h
h.......h
hRance-dono....h
h........h
h????h
(Sway sway sway)
The Toushin Toshifs shaking grew even stronger.
hRance-san, we have to escape...
 Since Upsilon was defeated, the Toushin Toshi has begun
 to collapse.h
hIs that true, Merim-san?h
hYes, since Upsilon was the entirety of the Toushin
 Toshi.
 The whole thing will break and fall to the surface.h
hThen, wefre.. gonna die here...h
hNo, no, Julia doesnft wanna die!h
hNo, we should be able to use the Landing Crafts in the
 Tousho Core.
 Since Upsilon isnft controlling them anymore, we should
 be able to manually control them.h
hThere were a lot of Landing Crafts, so I think we can
 save everyone in Cassado too.
 Anyway, letfs hurry.h
hThatfs good, then letfs do that!
 Then Rance.. Hey, Rance!h
hYeah, do whatever you want.h
hDo what we want, Rance..? What are you going to do?h
hIfm gonna stay here a little longer.h
hA little longer? Therefs no time!
 If we donft hurry, the Toushin Toshifs going to fall!h
hWhatever, just go! Go back to town and get everyone in
 those Landing Crafts or whatever! Go!h
hRance....h
hRance, the Landing Crafts are on the 5th floor of the
 Tousho Core.
 Youfd better show up.h
hYeah...h
Leaving me behind, everyone headed off to prepare to
escape.
(Sway sway sway)
With another big shake, some of the walls around me
started crumbling.
hSill... You fucking idiot..!h
I embraced Sill, who wasnft moving anymore.
Rance hWhat the hellfs a slave doing dying before her master?
       Organizing her masterfs funeral is a slavefs job too, you
       know!h
Rance hYou stupid, stupid, stupid.....!h
Rance h.................h
Sillfs body gradually got less and less warm...
Hm..? But shefs not getting cold.
Wait a second...
I put my ear to Sillfs chest.
(Thump  thump)
Rance hHeh...? Shefs alive??h
I try checking her heartbeat one more time.
(Thump thump)
I could definitely hear the sound of her heart beating.
Rance h.........h
Rance hHey, Sill.. Sill...!h
I shook her roughly and her eyelids, which I thought would be closed
forever, slowly began to open.
Sill hUhn.... ah.. Rance-sama?h
Rance hWhat do you mean fRance-samaf.. Youfre alive!
       Are you okay??h
Sill hYes, I guess I was unconscious for a little while...
      Umm, what happened to Upsilon...?h
hYou stupid idiot!!h
hKyan!h
hPretending to be dead!!
 I was worried about you!h
hRance-sama..?h
hWhat is it?h
hUmm.. Did you cry for me...?h
hTherefs no way Ifd ever cry!
 Who the hell would cry for you!!?
 Slaves are disposable!h
h.........h
(Sway sway sway sway)
The ground began shaking even more.
h...We canft stay here.
 Wefre running. The Toushin Toshifs falling.h
hEhhh?h
hUm, everyone.. Where is everyone..??h
hThey left me here and ran!
 Ifll never forgive them!h
hAnyway, wefre heading to those Landing Crafts!h
hYes, Rance-sama.h
