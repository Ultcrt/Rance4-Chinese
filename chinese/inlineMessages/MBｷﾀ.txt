hRance-sama, we already know there isnft a Landing Craft
 in here anymore.h
(Sway sway sway)
The Toushin Toshi shook violently again.
hShit! How dare they all leave me behind and run!!h
hAaagh, therefs no Landing Craft!h
hIt looks like itfs already been used to escape,
 Rance-sama.h
hDonft be so calm about this! Wefre in trouble!
 Letfs check another one!h
hYes.h
Therefs a thing that Merim called a Landing Craft here.
h.........h
hWhat is it, Rance-sama?h
hNah, itfs nothing.
 No point in sticking around here.
 Letfs go.h
We left the room.
hWhat the heck is this??
 A mysterious room with weird stuff lying around in
 it!!?h
hSome kind of ruins or magic devices, maybe?h
hUmm....h
Merim called out to us, timid as always.
hHm..? Merim?
 You rerõed this Toushin Toshi thing, right? So you
 know what these are?h
hOh, yes.h
hI think these are the Toushin Toshifs Landing Crafts.h
hLanding Crafts?
 What the heck are those?????h
hA Landing Craft is a kind of flying boat.h
hEh? They fly?
 I thought my Tulip #4 was humanityfs first flying
 vehicle...h
hIfm kind of disappointed.h
hThey fly, huh...? I see.h
hI think these Landing Crafts were used to send Tousho
 down to the surface to fight.
 Itfs amazing, isnft it?h
With that, Merim wandered deeper into the room and
started putting her hands all over the pillars and
things.
hWow, wow!
 Merimfs so happy!h
hRance-sama, could we use these to return to the
 surface?h
hUse.... these??h
For a split second, an image surfaced in my mind of me
using these Landing Crafts to hop right back to the
surface and being greeted by a million girls.
hI see, that is a good idea.
 Merim, get these Landing Crafts working.h
hOkay. I donft know if Ifll be able to do it, but Ifll
 check them out.h
Merim wandered around the Landing Crafts, taking notes
and looking like she was busy investigating.
h........Hmmm.h
h.......Oh, I see!h
hThen this part, umm...h
hOh!h
hWhat is it?h
hYes, I think they can be activated, but they seem to be
 receiving some kind of standby signal from somewhere...h
hSo they wonft work now.h
hYes, unfortunately.. but..h
hWe should be able to get them working if we can stop
 that standby signal.h
hStandby signal, huh? So whofs the one sending it?h
hProbably, the heart of the Toushin Toshi.. The Toushin.h
hSo where the heckfs this Toushin thing?h
hI donft know.h
hAnyway, for the meantime, we canft use these things to
 return to the surface, right?h
hItfs too bad, Rance-sama.
 But there must be another way.
 Letfs keep looking.h
hYou look by yourself.
 Shit.h
h.......h
h.....??h
hWhatfs this, Šó˜I?h
h.....I donft know.
 Merim-san might, but.. I...h
hTch, incompetent, trash, loser.
 Ifm gonna abandon you, you useless piece of crap.
 Study more.h
hYes, I understand.h
hIfll study, so please buy me some books.h
hNo way, thatfd have to come out of my porn-buying money.
 Go read in the store.h
h......h
We left the room with the mysterious things.
(Roll roll roll)
hHm.....?h
hRance-sama, whatfs that noise?h
(Roll roll roll)
h.....Owah!!h
(Roll roll roll roll roll)
The ball rolled by us at an incredible speed.
hPhew, wefre safe.h
hI bet itfs because we had this Ballcat Charm,
 Rance-sama.h
(Roll roll roll roll roll roll)
Rance hUgyaaaaa....!h
........
........
hRance-sama, therefs a sign.
 Somethingfs written on it.h
hLetfs see here.h
F             Warning                 F
FA [Ballcat Charm] is absolutely      F
Fnecessary to proceed past this point.F
FYou will 100% die without one.       F
hRance-sama, the Landing Crafts are in the Tousho Core.
 Not here.h
hRight, wefve gotta hurry!!h
hTherefs a transport device, Rance-sama.
 Should we use it?h
hLetfs see??h
hAlright, letfs go!h
hYes.h
We stood in the center of the magic circle on the ground.
Ascend stairs?
Ascending to higher floor.
Descend stairs?
Descending to lower floor.
... hPlease speak the activation code.h
A creepy, emotionless voice echoed from somewhere.
hActivation code?
 Whatfs that?h
... hPlease speak the activation code.h
Looks like Ifve gotta answer it.
What should I say?
... h*Beeeeep*.h
hSounds like that wasnft it, Rance-sama.h
hHmmmmmmmmm.h
hHey, what about fOpen Sesamef?
 Isnft fOpen Sesamef the go-to password?h
h.......h
hSeriously, try it, come on!h
hAlright, fine.h
I stood in front of the elevator once again and shouted.
hOpen Sesame!!!!h
... h..........h
... h*Beeeeeeep*.h
hTch, I didnft think itfd work.
 I was stupid to take something éä»‰ë said seriously.h
hBooooooo.h

... hThank you for using our services.

A creepy, emotionless voice echoed from somewhere.
hActivation code??h
... hPlease speak the activation code.h
hIt looks like we have to answer it, Rance-sama.h
hAlright.h
So what should I say?
hSirius.h
... h*Ding-dong*.
     Correct.h
We boarded the elevator.
... hWe are currently on floor

hLexington.h

     Correct.h
We boarded the elevator.

(Screeeeeeeeeeeeeeech)
(Screeeeeeeech)
(Clank)
... hYou have arrived at your destination.
     Please make sure you have all of your belongings.h
... hPlease make use of our services again.h
Doesnft look like therefs any reason to rõ thoroughly
here.
hRance-sama.. therefs something...
 Kya!h
Something appeared as if bubbling up from the ground.
Itfs a naked woman.
h...An enemy.h
hA naked lady... I get the feeling you go for the rough
 stuff with that grey skin.h
hWhat are you saying, Rance-sama?
 It looks like shefs our enemy.h
Atlanta hMy name is Atlanta.
         I have appeared to bring you misfortune.h
hMisfortune.. Deheheheheh.
 Ifm happy just seeing your body like this.h
hItfs a naked lady!
 Are you an exhibitionist, lady?h
Atlanta hDo you recognize whatfs in these mirrors?h
Atlanta took out two mirrors and showed them to me.
Ifm more interested in her body, but I guess Ifll look at
fem.
hWhat!!?h
hItfs ‰Á“Ş”ü-san and åQf-san, Rance-sama!
 Why!!?h
‰Á“Ş”ü and åQf were inside the two mirrors.
Atlanta hThatfs the deal. Get it?h
hWait a second, ‰Á“Ş”ü was here...
 Hey, ‰Á“Ş”ü.. ‰Á“Ş”ü.. Hey!
 Wherefd she go?h
hRance-sama, ‰Á“Ş”ü-sanfs gone!h
h‰Á“Ş”ü should be waiting for us back in town.h
Atlanta hI see. Then could the girl in this mirror be
         someone else??h
... hOpen this thing.. Let me out!!h
Someone like ‰Á“Ş”ü is shouting inside the mirror.
Itfs the voice of ‰Á“Ş”ü herself, very familiar to me.
hRance-sama, it must actually be ‰Á“Ş”ü-san trapped in
 that mirror!h
hShit!h
hThen Rance-sama, the other one...h
hBut åQf-san was in my party, right...... not here.h
åQf-san, who was right here a second ago, is gone.
håQf-san should be... in town, but...
 How could this..?h
Atlanta hThatfs the deal.
         Two of your companions are trapped in these
         mirrors.h
hWhat the hell do you think youfre doing!?
 What do you want, naked lady!?h
hPlease return ‰Á“Ş”ü-san and åQf-san to normal!h
Atlanta hItfs not that I want anything in particular.
         Ifm doing it fcause itfs fun.h
h........h
Atlanta hOh my, that troubled face youfre making..
         Itfs very nice.h
Atlanta hWhy donft you get even more troubled for me?h
hArgh, wefll take fem back by force!
 Stupid naked lady!h
But just when I jumped on her, Atlanta sunk back into the
ground the way she came.
hShit! Wherefd you run off to!?h
.. hI split the mirrors those two are in and hid the
    pieces of them somewhere in this dungeon.h
I can hear Atlantafs voice from somewhere...
But no matter where I look, I canft see her.
hShit, get out here!
 You coward!h
.. hGood luck finding those mirrors.
    If you donft find them soon, those girl might never
    be able to get out.. Hohohoho.h
hWhat was that, naked lady!?
 Ifm gonna open your legs up 180 degrees and shove a
 fucking baseball bat in you!h
hRance-sama....h
h..........h
hRance-sama.. The ‹¾”Váê•Ğs....h
hI got it.
 Wefve gotta look for fem.h
hThat was scary!
 But Ifm glad it wasnft éä»‰ë getting stuck inside a
 mirror. Yeah.h
The Green Slime remains in front of us, blocking our
path.
hItfs a Green Slime, Rance-sama.h
hAll ugly things must die.h
hLeave it to me!h
hMy Tulip #1 can blow apart something soft like this!h
àó—˜ˆŸ aimed her Tulip #1 at the Green Slime and fired.
(Whiiiiiiiiiiiistle)
   (Booooom)
Slime hUhya... Ifm a goner`.h
The Green Slime disappeared.
hA-hem!h
hYoufre amazing, àó—˜ˆŸ-san!
 *Clap* *clap*.h
hHmph, that was unnecessary.....
 I coulda destroyed that thing with my Lightning Flash
 Kick.. Well, whatever.h
The Green Slime disintigrated and we were able to
advance.
hAttack, Šó˜I.h
hYes, Rance-sama.h
hFire Arrow!h
Šó˜Ifs magic had absolutely no effect.
hIce Arrow!h
Šó˜Ifs magic had absolutely no effect.
hThunderstrike!!h
Šó˜Ifs magic had absolutely no effect.
h*Pant*.. *pant*.. *pant*.. Rance-sama..
 I canft do it.
 I think àó—˜ˆŸ-san could do something with her Tulip
 though...h
hIncompetent. Useless.h
h*Sob* *sob*.h
A translucent wall blocked our way through the
passageway.
hWhat the heckfs this??h
hItfs a Magic Wall, Rance-sama.
 A wall made with magic.h
hAlright, destroy it.h
hMe?h
hIfm not strong enough.
 Could you please do it, Shizuka-san?h
hSure thing. Ifll try.h
Shizuka faced the Magic Wall and put her hands together.
hHm..... Hmmmm, hm...!h
h...........h
(Snap)
With one last burst of power from Shizuka, the Magic Wall
was smashed to pieces.
hI knew you could do it, Shizuka-san! Youfre amazing!h
hPhew, well, we can get through now.h
hHrm, good work.
 You did well, Shizuka. Ifll praise you.h
hI didnft do it for you, Rance.h
Šó˜I faced the Magic Wall and put her hands together.
h....Hmmm, yah!h
h.......h
Nothing happened to the Magic Wall.
hRance-sama... Ifm sorry.
 It looks like Ifm not strong enough.h
hWhat!?h
hMagic Walls should break if you put more magic into them
 than they were created with, but...h
hI couldnft do it, but.. I bet Shizuka-san could.h
hShut it! Itfs your fault since you canft do it!h
(Hit hit hit hit)
h...Ifm sorry.h
We gave up on getting past the Magic Wall.
When we approached Chaofs room, we heard someone talking.
hIt looks like someonefs in there, Rance-sama.h
hYeah, letfs check it out.h
We hid in a corner of the passageway and peered into the
room.
hItfs those Helman Army guys. But why...?h
hI donft know.
 Letfs listen to their conversation.h
hYeah. Be quiet.h
..................
hWoman.
 I shall eliminate this Atlanta, so tell me where she
 is.h
hThere are many good things that could come of helping a
 Helman Councilman like myself.
 Kehya, kehya, kehya!h
Chao hBut Atlantafs so strong and dangerous!
      For your sake, Bitch-san, I donft think I can tell
      you where she is.h
Chao hAnd..
      One of your companions is trapped inside Atlantafs
      Mirror, right, Bitch-san?h
hYou mean Io?
 I donft care about that useless mage.h
Chao hPlease come back after youfve found this Io-san.
      If you do that, Ifll acknowledge your strength and
      tell you where Atlanta is.h
hVery well.
 We only need one more piece of Iofs mirror, anyway.
 Ifll show you what Ifm capable of.h
Chao hIfll be waiting for you, Bitch-san.h
hKehya, kehya, kehya, kehya!
 Letfs go, Dio.h
hI suppose you can come as well, ‹x”Œ“Á, Dens.h
hTheyfre coming, Rance-sama!h
hOh shit, itfd be annoying to have to deal with those
 guys right now.
 Letfs hide.h
We backed up and hid in the shadows of the passageway so
that Bitchfs group wouldnft see us.
Bitch and his blockheads quickly passed us by.
hIt looks like the Helman Army group has the same kind of
 promise with Chao-san as us, Rance-sama.h
hYeah...h
hTherefs something weird about that Chao girl.
 Shefs dangerous.h
hWell, no matter what happens, shefs still a woman.
 If anything happens, I can just push her down and rape
 her. Then everythingfll be fine.
 Therefs probably nothing to worry about.h
hYou have some awful thoughts, you know.h
When we approached Chaofs room, we heard someone talking.
hIt looks like someonefs in there, Rance-sama.
 I wonder if itfs the Helman group again?h
hHmm. Well, letfs hide and check it out again.h
hYes.h
We hid in a corner of the passageway and peered into the
room.
hThe Helman Army again, just like I thought...
 Chaofs mine, you know!h
hHey, shut up! Theyfll hear us!h
...........
hWoman!
 We cannot find Atlanta anywhere!
 You better not have given us false information!h
Chao hIt wasnft a lie!
      Atlanta is definitely here!h
hAre you telling the truth? I hope you know what will
 happen if you lie to me.
 Kehya, kehya, kehya!h
Chao hAtlanta is definitely hiding somewhere in this
      dungeon. Thatfs the truth. Please defeat her with
      your power, Bitch-sama.h
hI suppose Ifve got no choice. Very well.
 But youfd better not forget about the N Key.h
Chao hOf course. I understand.h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!
 Letfs go, Dio.h
Bitch and the rest of fem quickly left the room again.
We hid in the passageway and waited for Bitch and the
rest of them to pass by, then returned to Chaofs room.
hRance-sama, the Helman Army is looking for Atlanta
 too...h
hWell, they can look all they want.
 But since I beat her already, they wonft find her.h
... hHohohohohohoho.....h
hThis voice is...h
hItfs coming from the room, Rance-sama.
 Chao-san shouldnft be in there though...h
We looked into the room one more time.
Chao hHohohohohohohoho, fools.h
Chao hGo ahead and fight my doubles as much as youfd
      like.h
hRance-sama....h
hChaofs Atlanta..
 What the heckfs going on?h
Chao hBut itfs probably impossible for that man.
      Hefs too far from the ideal Ifm looking for.h
Chao hIfd like to see at least one other person than that
      Rance man with the power to defeat my doubles.h
Chao hMy master wishes for the body of a strong man after
      all.h
h...Rance-sama!h
hLooks like she tricked us.
 How ridiculous.h
hWhat should we do?h
hWhat do you think? We should jump out in front of her
 and kill fer!h
hBut, Rance-sama...
 Then we might not be able to find the key.h
h........h
hWhy donft we pretend we donft know for a little while
 longer and see what happens?h
hYeah, I guess wefll pretend wefre still fooled and wait
 for our chance.h
