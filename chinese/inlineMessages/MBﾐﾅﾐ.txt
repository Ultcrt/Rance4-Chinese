 There are stairs leading up.
 There are stairs leading down.
 Therefs a transport device.
 Therefs a sign.
Alright, Ifm gonna look for monsters.
(Look look look)
Unfortunately, I couldnft find any monsters.
Unfortunately, I couldnft find any monsters.
The door wonft open.
Therefs a big lake blocking our progress, so it looks
like we wonft be able to continue southward.
hRance-sama, the lake looks really deep. It doesnft look
 like wefll be able to cross it.h
hWe could if we had a boat.
 Itfs too bad.h
The door wonft open.
The door wonft open.
Itfs locked from the other side, so it wonft open.
The door wonft open.
Ascend stairs?
Ascending to higher floor.
Descend stairs?
Descending to lower floor.
hTherefs a transport device, Rance-sama.
 Should we use it?h
hLetfs see??h
hAlright, letfs go!h
hYes.h
We stood in the center of the magic circle on the ground.
Doesnft look like therefs any reason to search thoroughly
here.
hRance, therefs something in the wall.h
h.......h
hIt looks like a picture.h
Obtained (Famous Picture 7).
hBut I wonder why there was a picture lying around
 here??h
hfCause itfs trash, I guess.h
h*Squeak*..!h
hKyaaa, a mouse!!h
A mouse jumped out onto the path in front of us.
hWhatfs with this guy?h
hLookinf for a good deal, mister?h
hItfs the Pervert Mouse...h
hYou know him, Kanami?h
hYeah, he was living in Leazas Castle about a year ago.h
hHefs a terrible mouse who steals girlsf panties and
 stuff.h
hTsk, tsk, thatfs all in the past now, isnft it?h
hYeah, right!
 Ifll exterminate you!h
I held Kanami back before she could jump on the mouse.
hWait a minute.
 He sounds kinda interesting.
 Letfs hear what he has to say.h
hGood idea.h
hWhat the heck are you?h
hI am called Pervert Mouse.
 Ifm just a mouse with certain... interests.h
hI see. So what do you want with me?h
hIfve got something I think you might be interested in
 buying.h
hSomething Ifd buy?h
hI dunno what it is, but I donft like spending money.
 Gimme it for free.h
hIfm afraid Ifll have to decline.. *squeak*.h
hFine, whatever.
 What is it anyway?h
hIfve taken an interest in pictures lately.
 And this one Ifve got is pretty interesting.h
h.....h
hThe thing is..
 Ifve acquired a rather embarrassing picture of one of
 your companions, mister.h
hYou what?!h
hEhhh, no way!h
hHey, it better not be me!h
hIs it me...??h
hTake a picture of Julia!!h
hSo I thought maybe youfd be interested in buying it,
 mister.h
hReally?h
hItfs a pretty nice picture.
 You wonft regret it.h
h.....h
hIf youfre interested in purchasing it, meet me back here
 tomorrow.
 Well then.. *squeak*.h
The Pervert Mouse ran off swiftly.
hRance-sama, we should exterminate a terrible Pervert
 Mouse like that, donft you think?h
hA sexy picture..h
hRance-sama..!h
hA sexy, perverted picture..h
h..........h
hKya!h
h*Squeak*.h
The Pervert Mouse jumped out onto the path.
hHello, mister.h
hYo.h
hThat picture from yesterday.h
h*Squeak*.h
hYou brought it, right?h
The Pervert Mouse took what appeared to be the picture
from its side and waved it about.
hItfs top notch stuff.h
hThe pricefll be 
 gold.
 I wonft negotiate.h
hW-WHAT!!?h
hItfs high, itfs too high!h
hWell itfs not like you have to buy it...
 So whatfll it be?h
Hmmmm, I want the dirty picture, but...
hI got it, Ifll buy.h
hNegotiations are complete then.h
I bought the dirty picture from the Pervert Mouse for
 gold.
hWell then, Ifll be seeing you.
 *Squeak*.h
The Pervert Mouse disappeared in the blink of an eye.
hRance-sama.. the picture..?h
hRight, right, the sexy picture..!h
I took out the picture.
hOh.. Itfs me. No..!h
hHow careless, Sill.
 Whatfs all this about?h
hEh..?h
hDonft show your body to any other men than me, you
 idiot!
 Itfs my right and only my right to appreciate your body
 from head to toe!h
hEh.. ah, yes.h
hHmph. Be careful when you change from now on.h
hWhofd buy anything at that ridiculous price, moron?h
hAh, I see.. Thatfs too bad.
 Well then, *squeak*.h
The Pervert Mouse disappeared from sight.
hI want the picture.h
hThen please pay.h
hBut Ifm not gonna pay.h
hThen Ifm afraid we canft negotiate.h
hRight, I donft intend to negiotiate.
 Ifm gonna kill you.h
h*Squeak*!h
(Stab)
I consigned the Pervert Mouse to oblivion with one
thrust.
hRance-sama, itfs the Helman group!h
h.........h
hThe door still wonft open, huh?
 How frustrating.h
h........h
hRance-sama, what should we do?h
h....Letfs ignore them for now.h
...We should avoid fighting them for now since theyfve
got that Dio guy with them.
I decided to leave them be.
hRance-sama, someonefs there!h
hItfs the Helman guys...h
h.......h
hAargh, what is this!?
 This stupid door still wonft open!?h
hHubert, hurry up and do it.
 Youfre such a useless man.h
hIf youfre so great, then why donft you do it?h
hY-yeah.h
hMy orders are the orders of the Emperor!
 Youfll be court-martialed if you disobey them!h
h......h
hThatfs right! Dio, my supreme guard doll!
 Destroy this door!h
hI have no interest in anything other than killing.
 Ifm a being created to fight after all.h
hAll of you are useless!
 Why are all of my subordinates so incompetent when Ifm
 so accomplished?h
hWhat the heck are they up to?h
hIt looks like theyfre trying to get that door open.h
hLooks like theyfre having trouble.
 Itfs always pleasant to see your enemies struggling.h
hShit, wefve gotta get those keys before that damn Leazas
 group.
 We must hurry.h
hYou know this is all your fault for using Merim as a
 shield and running, right?h
hYeah, if we had her, we wouldnft be having trouble with
 this stupid door!h
hSilence!!
 All you need to do is follow my orders!h
h.....Bitch-sama!h
hWhat is it, Merim?h
Merim grabbed a small rock at her feet and threw it at
Bitch.
(Whooooooosh)
(Tap)
The small stone hit Bitch in the back.
hOw! Who was that?!h
h...Merim, eh?
 I see, so youfve betrayed us?h
hWell, since we seem to be at an impasse, we might as
 well eliminate the competition.h
We showed ourselves to Bitchfs group.
hGahahahahahahahahahaha!
 Rance-sama the hero appears!h
hEvil men serving the evil Helman Empire!
 Ifll punish you on behalf of the heavens!h
hRance-san, Rance-san!
 The Helman Empire isnft evil.h
h......h
hPlease donft be so mean.
 There are many good people in Helman too.h
h....Well, whatever.
 I guess Ifll correct myself then.h
hMen from the Helman Empire where there are a lot of evil
 people!
 Ifll kill you all!h
hKehya, kehya!
 You again? Youfre persistent.h
hWell then, letfs fight!h
hWait, wait, wait, donft get ahead of yourself.
 I wonft be the one fighting you.h
hWhat??h
hDio!
 Show me your power!h
hI can kill them all?h
hKehya, kehya, do as you like!h
hRance-sama, he might be a Tousho!h
hIt doesnft matter what he is.
 If hefs trying to fight me, hefs gonna die.
 Letfs go!h
We entered battle with Dio.
hRance-sama, he IS a Tousho!
 We canft beat him!h
hShit, retreat!h
Rance decided to retreat.
hDio! Donft let them escape!h
hYeah, yeah.
 Theyfve got guts, but theyfre no match for me.
 Ifll kill fem all.h
hRance-sama, Diofs coming!!h
hYou wonft get away!h
hKuh... hefs persistent.h
hShit, retreat!h
hYes!h
We backed away from Dio again.
hHe wonft follow us up the stairs, will he?h
We climbed the stairs.
hYou wonft get away from me, trash!
 Ifm adding you to my collection!h
hRance-samaaa....!h
hKuh...!h
hJuliafs scared!h
hRance-sama, itfs a dead end!h
hCanft run anymore, huh?h
hShit! You know, women donft like persistent men!h
hItfs time to finish you!h
hRance-sama, we canft win against him!h
h.....Hrmmmmmmm!h
Dio started charging up for a final strike.
hHey, wait a second.. seriously, wait!
 Letfs talk this through!h
hItfs fun seeing my prey make its final pleas for its
 life.h
hWhat!?
 Whenfd I plead for my life...!?h
hHeh heh heh, now die!h
hKyaaaa, Rance-sama!h
hThatfs right!
 The Return Bonsai!h
I swiftly took out the Return Bonsai and held it up.
hDie!h
EEEEEReturnEEEEEE
hPhew, man.
 That was a little, just a tiny bit, dangerous.h
hWe almost died!
 My heartfs still pounding!h
hReally? Letfs see.h
I grabbed Sillfs breast casually.
hKyan!h
hGrope grope, yep, itfs certainly pounding.
 Mmfufu.h
I relaxed and started thinking while groping Sillfs
boobs.
......That weirdofs...
Dio the Tousho...?
All I know is hefs pretty strong.
Hmmm, I guess this is a tiny problem.
hRance-sama, hefs super strong!
 If itfs just us....h
hWhat?! You think I canft beat him?!h
hMe, the strongest in the world...?
 Me, the coolest in the world..?h
hSill, whofs the strongest man in the world?h
I asked Sill, thrusting my chest out.
hThatfs... well... you are, Rance-sama.h
hRight, I am.
 Therefs only one reason to think that I couldnft beat
 that Tousho Dio.h
h.......h
hYou guys are all dragging me down!
 None of you are any fucking use!h
h........h
hOh, gimme a break...h
hIfm sorry.. Is it Juliafs fault??h
hSo, Rance-sama.. what should we do?
 Wefll probably have to fight him again.h
hWefll win. Next time, wefll win.
 We donft need strategies or nothinf. Wefll win fcause
 Ifm strong!
 Gahahahahahahahahahaha!h
hUmm....h
hWhat is it, Merim??h
hI donft think youfll be able to defeat a Tousho.h
hThe Tousho created by the Holy Magic Sect canft quite
 defeat Dark Lords, but theyfre incredibly strong.
 Humans canft possibly defeat them.h
hI bet youfre not aware, Merim, but, *ahem*, Ifve
 defeated Dark Lords before.
 Ifm invincible!h
hEh... Really??h
hYeah.. Well, itfs pretty much the truth.h
hIt was thanks to the Demon Sword Chaos though.h
hNuh-uh, that retard sword had nothing to do with it.
 It was my ability.h
hAnyway, next time we fight, Ifll kill the bastard.h
hGahahahahahahahahahaha...!h
Rance-kun had completely forgotten about how he had very
recently barely escaped with his life.
hRance-sama, someonefs there!h
hWhat the hellfs that?h
Before us is a weird monster dragging a Dragon Girl
behind it.
Octoman hChop, chop, chop!h
(Drag drag drag)
Octoman hChop, chop, chop!h
(Drag drag drag)
Octoman hChop, chop, aah!h
When he noticed us, the Octoman freaked out and ran off.
h....What was that about?h
hWell, an Octoman was dragging a Dragon Girl.h
hI figured that out, thanks.
 Anyway, letfs follow fem.h
hYes.h
Octoman hChop, chop!
         Thatfs as far as you go!h
Several Octomen appeared before us.
Octoman hChop, chop!
         From this point on is our great Octoman
         Kingdom!h
Octoman hChop, chop!
         Itfs no place for you lower life forms!h
hWhatfd you say, octopus bastard!?h
hIf you get in our way, Ifll make you into takoyaki and
 sell you at a stand for 20 yen a piece!h
Octoman hChop, chop!
         Looks like you just donft understand, you
         inferior creature!h
Octoman hChop, chop!
         Wefll show you the skill of the Octoman Empirefs
         6th Defense Regiment!h
hHmph, trash.h
Octoman hChop, chop!
         Soldiers, attack!h
hThis is.... I see.
 Looks like we took a shortcut and got in front of the
 Helman guys.h
hWe did it, Rance-sama!
 The Helman group is probably still trying to get through
 that door, so letfs hurry up and find the S Key while
 wefve got the chance!h
hYeah.h
hCold...!h
hRance-samaa, itfs really cold!
 I donft think we can go any farther!h
It certainly is really fucking cold.
Itfs like 0 degrees or like -100 degrees or some shit.
(Shiver shiver shiver shiver)
hLetfs turn back, Rance-sama!h
hJuliafs cold too.. *Shiver* *shiver*.
 I donft like the cold.. *Shiver* *shiver*.h
hItfs really too cold.
 My hands are numb and I donft think I can use my
 shuriken.h
hShit!h
Doesnft seem like we can proceed further than this.
Sailor hRance, messenger from hell!
        Ifll defeat you on behalf of heaven!h
hYou again??h
Sailor hI blundered last time, but evil canft possibly
        triumph twice!h
hIfm justice, so Ifve got nothing to do with that.
 I canft lose.h
hGahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!h
Sailor hYou piss me off, you asshole!
        Ifll kill you!h
hHahahahaha, just try it!
 Ifll have sex with you whenever you want, babe!h
The Sailor attacked.
Blazer hOh my, Sailor lost again, huh?
        Shefs hopeless.h
hI pounded her good.
 Now itfs your turn!h
Blazer hWhat a boor.h
Blazer hIfd like to study soon, so Ifll take care of you
        quickly.h
hHmph.h
The Blazer attacked.
Jumper hWaah, waah, waah!h
hSo youfre the last one?h
Jumper hWaah... yeah.h
hLetfs go.h
Jumper hWefre gonna fight..??h
hWerenft you waiting to ambush me so we could fight?
 If you donft want to, get out of our way.h
Jumper hNo.h
hWell then, wefre gonna fight.h
Jumper hEhhhh? Wefre gonna fight??h
hMake up your goddamn mind!!
 What do you wanna do!?h
Jumper hThen why donft you kill yourself? Huh? Huh?h
The Jumper attacked.
Cantel hHuman-made medicine works really well. You really
        helped me out. I think I can rest well now.h
hAre you going to stay here, Mr. Dragon?h
Cantel hUnless this Toushin Toshi is destroyed, I canft
        get out.h
hHefs like a captain who wants to go down with his
 ship... Thatfs pretty manly.h
Cantel hIfm pretty sure I told you this before, but I
        just canft leave the room because my bodyfs too
        big.h
hShut it! Donft talk back to me when Ifm going out of my
 way to praise you!h
Cantel h..........h
Cantel hDid you get the medicine yet? My sneezes could
        freeze you solid, so you shouldnft approach me
        for no reason.h
hIfll go get it right away, so blow your nose and sleep
 or something.h
Cantel hThe medicinefs in the Buoyancy Stafffs.. ah..
        a..h
Cantel h*Achoo*!h
(Spuuuurt)
The dragonfs cold sneeze washed over us.
hKyaaa, cold!!h
hUwah, you asshole!h
Cantel hSorry, sorry.h
Cantel hOh? You guys again..?
        Whatfs your business?h
hIs your brain frozen too, you rotten dragon?
 Here, itfs that medicine.h
I showed the Dragonfs Cold Medicine to the dragon
asshole.
hI went out of my way to go and get this for you.
 So hurry up and hand over the S Key!h
Cantel hWell, it was a promise..
        I guess Ifve got no choice...h
hWhat the hellfs with that attitude when Ifm being this
 fucking nice getting the thing you wanted for you?!
 Donft you know how to be thankful?!h
hRance-samaaa....h
Cantel h.............h
Cantel hNo, Ifm sorry about that, of course Ifm
        thankful....h
hWell, I suppose I could forgive you because of your
 honest nature. Gahahahaha!h
h...............h
Cantel h...Herefs the key... You were saying something
        about four keys or whatever, so I think this must
        be the key you were looking for...h
I handed the Dragonfs Cold Medicine over to the dragon
and received the S Key in return.
hIt certainly seems to be the S Key.
 Alright.h
Cantel hWhat do you plan to do with a key like that??h
hItfs got nothing to do with you.
 Just drink the stupid medicine and take a nap already.h
We obtained the S Key, so we decided to return to town
for now.

Alice hThatfs the end of chapter 4.h
Yukichi hCaaw, caaaw.h
Alice hThen Ifll give you some hints...h
Alice hPlease use poor Merim-chan, okay?
       If she keeps getting knocked down and standing
       back up again, Ifm sure something good will happen
       even to Merim-chan.h
Alice hDid you meet the Hanny King?
       If youfve met him, something good might happen if
       you bring him a girl you think hefd like.h
Alice hYou should do your best to aim for the top floor
       of the South Tower.
       Definitely.. right, Yukichi?h
Yukichi hCaw......h
Alice hCheck out the Item Shopfs bargain bin every once

hOwah!h
hRance-sama, a d.. d.. d..!h
hA d... dragon!h
hI know! I can tell itfs a dragon by fucking looking!h
Dragon h....Humans, eh...?h
Dragon hA.. *achoo*!h
hUwah!h
hKya... cold!!h
The fuckinf dragon blew a super cold sneeze at us.
hI see. This guyfs the reason itfs so cold around here.h
hThis is the Toushin Toshifs defense dragon!
 To think itfs still alive! Thatfs so amazing! Ifm so
 moved!h
Merimfs getting really excited on her own again.
Ifll ignore her since I feel like shefll go on for a
while if I ask her about it.
Cantel hHumans, huh... For what reason have you come
        here?h
Cantel hIt doesnft look like youfre here to see the fool
        who couldnft protect Upsilonfs skies....h
hWhat the hell are you talking about?h
Cantel hIf you have no business here, you should leave
        quickly.
        This cold is dangerous to humans...h
hDangerous? Tch.
 Wefd be fine if youfd stop spewing that cold air out!h
hRance-sama, you shouldnft make the dragon angry!h
Cantel hIfve had a cold for the last several decades, you
        see...
        I canft control my body temperature.
        Sorry about this....h
hTch. A frickinf cold? What a pathetic loser.h
hIf only we had some cold medicine that would work on a
 dragon...h
Cantel hOhh! Yes! I was forgetting about that!
        I donft suppose you cold fetch me some medicine,
        humans?h
hHuh? Something like that actually exists?h
Cantel hThere used to be special mages who would tend to
        the wounds of us dragons when we were injured in
        battle.h
hSo if we go to where those people used to work, we might
 find some cold medicine?h
Cantel hYes, there should still be some left.
        Please....h
hWell, itfll depend.h
hWhat are you gonna do for me?
 The worldfs not such a nice place that Ifd go and get it
 for you for free.h
hR-Rance-sama...h
Cantel hTherefs nothing I can do for you. I canft even
        leave this room with this large body of mine....h
hYou must have some kinda treasure though, right? Most
 dragons in games are hiding some kinda super treasure,
 after all.h
Cantel hI entered this city to fight the Demon Army.
        I have no belongings other than this small key..h
hWhat a pathetic dragon.h
hRance-sama, maybe the key he has is one of the four
 wefre looking for.h
hOh, right. Hey, dragon.
 Is that key you have the S Key?h
Cantel hThe S Key... Yes, I believe it was something like
        that.h
hAlright.
 But we could just defeat this thing instead of running
 around doing errands for him.h
hNo way! That would be dangerous!h
hIfm against it as well. I wonft say theyfre as strong as
 Dark Lords, but dragons arenft something humans can hope
 to challenge.h
hShit, this is annoying.........
 Wherefs the fuckinf medicine?h
Cantel hYoufll go? Ifm thankful..
        It should be at the top of the Buoyancy Staff.h
hWefre trading for the key you have, got it?h
Cantel h...Understood....h
