This is the Tulip #4 tent.
hWell, àó—˜ˆŸ.
 What are we gonna do now?h
hLetfs look for —–z and Sill-chan as per our original
 goal.h
hI suppose. Thatfs the best plan.
 And one more thing, àó—˜ˆŸ-san.h
hYes, what is it?h
hIs there any way to repair the Tulip #4?
 If it can be fixed, I think you should fix it.h
hUnfortunately, if itfs this broken.. therefs nothing I
 can do.
 I donft have any materials or tools anyway...h
hI see...h
hHey, is dinner ready yet?
 éä»‰ëfs hungry.h
h...........h
They look like the ramparts(?) of the floating continent.
Itfs a very dangerous place. You could take quite the
long fall if youfre not careful here.
I wonder if —–z is really here?
Therefs nothing really unusual.
My Tulip #4, the great invention of the century that I
poured my heart and soul into making, lies before me in a
tragic state.
Sorry... #4.
This is the Tulip #4 àó—˜ˆŸ made.
Itfs kind of amazing how she can keep pumping these
things out.
We made this tent from the ruins of the Tulip #4.
It doesnft look very pretty, but itfll do for now.
Itfs a crummy tent.
hSill, rõ for valuables.h
hI donft think there are any, —–z-sama.h
hIfm not asking for your opinion, Ifm ordering you to
 look.h
hYes, I understand.h
(Rustle rustle rustle rustle)
Sillfs rõing around the tent.
hI didnft really find anything, —–z-sama.h
hYou liar, you were being half-assed about it from the
 beginning.
 Ifm gonna punish you.h
I pulled Sill close and suddenly stuck my hand into her
panties.
hOh...!h
hPunishment #1, attack!!h
The hand I stuck into her panties continued its advance
and I stuck a finger directly into her pussy.
hOh.. —–z-samaaa.. ouch..!h
hGahahahahahaha..!h
hLetfs hurry up and start our rõ.h
hYeah, letfs.h
hHm?
 Whatfs that?h
hWhat are you doing, Kanami-san?h
h.......h
hLong-distance vision.h
hLong-distance vision..?
 Where you train your eyes to be able to see things from
 really far away?h
hYeah, ninjas have gotta have good eyes after all.
 Lately youfve gotta at least have 2.5.h
h2.5.. Amazing.
 Ifm only.. 0.01.. you know.h
hThis is nothing but scrap now, àó—˜ˆŸ.h
So said u—¥ as she banged on my beloved Tulip #4.
h....Yeah.h
hDidnft making it cost a ton of money?h
hN.. no, not really.
 Princess Lia prepared the things I needed..
 Ifm not sure what the cost ended up being.h
hProbably more than Kathtomfs earnings for a whole year.
 What a waste.h
h..Oh, Shizuka!
 Donft be so mean!h
I started feeling sad and some tears welled up.
h..*Sniffle*...h
hHey, donft cry.
 I was just joking, geez.h
hàó—˜ˆŸ-chan, àó—˜ˆŸ-chan.h
hOh, éä»‰ë-san.
 Do you need something?h
héä»‰ë needs to pee...
 Wherefs the bathroom?h
Maybe shefd been holding it for a while because éä»‰ë was
hopping about as she spoke.
hBathroom?
 Wefve all just been using the bushes over there.h
hEhhhhhhh?
 Thatfs embarrassing.. I donft wannaa!h
hCfmon, àó—˜ˆŸ-chan.
 Canft you do something?h
hBathroom, bathroom, bathroom!h
hEven if you whine like that.. everyone else is putting
 up with it too...h
hBathroom, bathroom.. waaaah!h
héä»‰ë!!h
hOh, Captain åQf.h
hDonft be such a baby!
 Just go in the bushes.h
hEhhhh?h
hHow can you say such things as a Royal Guard?h
åQf-san dragged éä»‰ë away.
h....*Sigh*.
 Why do we have a novice like her again?h
Therefs no way an elite aristocratic gentleman such as I
could ever stay in such a crummy tent.
hAre we done for today already, àó—˜ˆŸ-san?
 Isnft it still a little early?h
hOh, youfre right.
 Ifm kind of out of it.. sorry.h
hTherefs no need to apologize.
 Cfmon, letfs go.h
hYeah.h
hUmm.. itfs night now, so..
 letfs not go outside anymore.h
hItfs dangerous.. yes.h
hYeah, itfs dark.h
hThe sun has set, àó—˜ˆŸ-dono.
 Taking action at night is dangerous, so I believe we
 should rest for now.h
hWe wonft find anything by pushing ourselves.
 Letfs rest for the night.h
hYeah, itfs already dark.
 Letfs eat and get to bed.h
Wefre going to the meadow.
hThen letfs head out to rõ Ylapu.
 Wefre looking for clues to finding —–z.h
hItfd be nice if we ended up just looking out and seeing
 him, huh.h
hLife isnft that easy, Shizuka-san.h
hAnyway, letfs head out.
 There may be monsters, so donft forget your equipment.h
hHey, hey, Captain àó—˜ˆŸ.
 Whatfre we doing about guarding the tent?h
hGuarding the tent?h
hYeah, if we leave the tent empty, thieves might come, so
 itfs dangerous.h
hWe donft need to worry about that.
 There isnft anything important in there and I bet no one
 will come anyway.h
hMmkay, then letfs go!h
hWhat the hellfs this scrap iron?h
hUh huhhhh, this is the Tulip #4 àó—˜ˆŸ made, huh?
 Itfs trash.h
hItfs too bad itfs all broken like this.h
hWhatfs too bad?h
hThis flies, so àó—˜ˆŸ-san and everyone used it to get
 here.h
hIf it werenft broken, we could have used this to get
 back to the surface....h
hNothingfll come of regretting it now.
 No looking to the past.h
hYes.h
The broken-down Tulip #4 stands before me.
