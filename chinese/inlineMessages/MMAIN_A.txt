hRance-sama, it looks like this transport device is
 one-way, so we canft use it from this side.h
hSo this is the last stop.
 Then how the hell are we supposed to get back?h
hI think there must be another transport device somewhere

The door was shut tight and wouldnft open.
It seems like itfs locked, but I donft see a keyhole.

hIfve gotta lift this door, right?h
I stuck my hands in the gap underneath the door and
pulled up, hard.

The surprisingly light door opened like a shutter.

hBut then, we shouldnft use this...h
hI know that.
 I was joking. Hmph.h
hAlright, letfs go!h
hYes.h
We stood in the center of the magic circle on the ground.
Moving to Tousho Core
.........
hWhat?
 Wefre back in town!?h
hIt looks like that transport device is there to return
 to the outside, Rance-sama.h
Ascend stairs?
Ascending to higher floor.
Descend stairs?
Descending to lower floor.
Doesnft look like therefs any reason to rõ thoroughly
here.
hKyaaaaa!h
hHm, a scream?h
hAnd itfs a womanfs scream too.. letfs go, Sill.h
hYes, Rance-sama.h
I ran towards the screams.
hOh, look at this!!!h
hRance-sama, a girl is being attacked by a monster!h
hWhat, a monsterfs being attacked by a girl?h
hNo, the girl is being attacked.h
hHm, hm.h
... hKyaaaa, help me..!!h
Ohh, a girl with exposed skin is being attacked by a Nubobo.
Sill hRance-sama, we should save... eh?h
I grabbed Sillfs hand and shook my head.
Rance hA beautiful girl is being attacked by a monster here.
       We should observe until shefs just about to get done in.h
Sill hRance-sama...h
Rance hDonft worry, I wonft let a good woman like that get killed by
       a monster. Ifll save her right at the last minute.
       But man, this is dirty.h
The Nubobo is attacking the girl with bloodshot eyes.
Nubobo hOhohohohohooon.h
Girl hKyaaaa, no!
      Donft do anything weird!!h
The Nubobo uses its large hands to violently grope the beautyfs
breasts and uses its tail to lewdly stroke the beautyfs secret place.
Girl h..Kuh.. *gasp*.. AAaah..!h
Nubobo hOhohohohohohohoon!
        Duh you like dat?h
Girl h......h
The beautyfs ignoring him, but from how wet she is..
She likes it.
This is nice.. I wanna go over there and stick my destructive weapon
into that wet pussy.
Nubobo hOhohohohoon.
        I canft take dis anymore.h
Girl h.........................h
Nubobo hOoh, good, good.h
Girl h.........................h
Sill hRance-sama, that girl is whispering something to the monster.h
Rance hI bet shefs saying something like fI canft take it anymore,
       just put it in alreadyf.h
Sill hIt doesnft really look like that though...h
The Nubobofs eyes became more bloodshot and it started attacking
harder.
Girl hOh, enough already!!h
Girl hThunderstrike!!h
Powerful lightning struck the Nubobo and it was blown
away.
hWhat the hell? She defeated the monster on her own!h
hBut Rance-sama, it looks like shefs unconscious.
 Letfs go help her.h
hYes, I guess so.h
hHelping people.. helping people.. helping ladies...h
(Walk walk)
I sat the woman up and held her.
My hand accidentally touched her seductive skin, but it
just happened, so itfs not like I could have done
anything to avoid it.. Ufufufu.
hHey, you okay?h
hTh.. thank you.h
hDonft worry, I completely destroyed that evil monster.h
hRance-sama, she defeated the...h
hShut up.h
h.....h
hThank you very much.
 My name is Io Ishtar.h
hI came to this dungeon to pick bamboo shoots, but I was
 attacked by a monster that appeared out of nowhere...h
hI see, that must have been terrible.h
hYes.h
hWell then, letfs get down to business.h
hIfm not an honorable hero of justice doing charity work.
 Got it?h
hOf course. The world isnft so convenient as that.h
hYou want me to thank you for saving me, right?h
hRight, you understand well.
 Ifm a nice guy, so if you donft have any money....h
hPlease allow me to thank you.h
Io stared into my eyes.
h.........h
hIn thanks, Ifll give you.. everything.h
h..........h
h..........h
h....Okay.h
hRance-san, youfll do me a favor, wonft you?h
hY.. yeah.h
Ifll listen to any request from my beloved Io.
hRance-sama, Rance-sama...!h
hWhat did you do to Rance-sama!!?h
hI didnft really do anything.h
hThatfs a lie.... You cast a spell, you cast a Charm
 spell on Rance-sama!h
hThatfs right, I did. Fufufu..
 Why donft you undo it then? That is, if you can.h
hRelease the spell, and release Rance-sama right now!
 If you donft, Ifll.. Ifll defeat you!h
hHmm..? I see.h
hRance-saaan, that Sill girlfs being mean to me!h
Io suddenly started crying and clung to Rance.
hWhat!? Sill is?h
hNo, Rance-sama! Rance-sama, that girl cast a spell on
 you..!h
hShut up! Youfre just a slave, youfve got no right to lay
 a hand on my beloved!h
(Hit hit hit hit)
h.....Rance-sama!h
hGot it, Sill?
 Donft do anything to Io anymore. Got it?h
hIo, I scolded Sill, so please forgive her.h
hThatfs fine. Thank you.
 My beloved Rance-san.h
hGahahahahahahaha... Ifm so embarrassed!h
hRance-sama.. no waaay..!h
hHey, Rance-san.
 Could you please do me a favor?h
hSure. Ifd do anything for you, Io.h
hI want you to find a key for me.h
hA key... A key, huh?h
hYeah, there are four keys hidden somewhere in this
 Toushin Toshi.
 I need them.. Rance-san.h
hI got it. If itfs for you, Ifll look for these keys.h
hReally, Rance-san? Thank you!
 I love you!h
Io joined the party.
hAlright, letfs go.h
hPlease do your best, Rance-san!
 But...h
hWhat is it?h
hDo your best in bed tonight, too.
 *Giggle* *giggle*.h
hIn bed... whoa, of course.h
hThis is it, right, Rick?h
hYes.
 We landed down this path and through the third warp
 device from the left.h
hThe third from the left... If I remember correctly,
 thatfs...h
hThe door was locked and we couldnft open it.h
hWe unlocked it from the inside, so it should be open.h
hRance-sama, letfs hurry.
 Letfs hurry and save everyone!h
hI guess so.
 They ARE all my women, I suppose.
 I guess I gotta take care of fem.h
hJulia doesnft wanna go back there.
 Itfs scary.h
hRance-san, letfs just defeat the weak monsters around
 here and play.h
hNah, we canft.
 I mean, Ifm a hero of justice, you know.
 Ifve gotta save ladies in trouble.h
hI knew youfd say that, Rance-dono.
 Now, letfs go.h
hKuh, kuh, hee, hee, hee.h
hItfs Happy Fukuda-san, Rance-sama.
 I wonder what hefs doing?h
hHey, gloomy freak.h
(Punt)
I gave Happy Fukuda a kick in the head as he squatted and
messed with his computer.
hOww, what was that for!?h
hHey, whatcha doinf?h
hI was using my computer.
 Itfs got nothing to do with you.h
h........h
hGuess I bothered you.h
h......Hm??h
hRance-sama, something smells.h
The area was filled with an unpleasant stench.
hGross, this.. this smells like somebody who hasnft taken
 a bath in a while.h
hYes, it smells pretty bad.
 I wonder if therefs someone living here?h
hProbably.h
(Beeb-boop)
hRance-sama, what was that noise?h
hWhofs there!!?h
I spun to face the direction the noise had come from.
hAh.. Whofs there?
 Youfre being a bit louder than Ifd like.h
A man who was nothing but skin and bones sat there in
ragged clothes.
By the manfs feet are a bunch of weird, blinking machines
in the middle of a mess of wires.
hWhat the heckfre you?
 What are you doing in here?h
hIfm Happy Fukuda.
 Oh, donft step there.h
hHuh? Owah!h
hThese are valuable gilt cables.
 Theyfre expensive, geez.
 If you break them, youfll have to reimburse me.h
....What the hell is this weird spindly guy..?
Happy Fukuda? Oh.. Right, I remember now.
Didnft the item shop girl Yocchan ask me to give
something to this guy?
hHey, I got something Ifm supposed to give you.
 You want this?h
I took out the Pintel 486.
hOh, thatfs a [Pintel 486]!!
 Thatfs great, Ifm so lucky!h
I handed the Pintel 486 over to Fukuda.
hAnyway, Ifve delivered it.
 So what is that thing??h
hThis iiiis...h
hA part that increases a computerfs processing speed!h
hFufufufufufu, now my computerfs processing speed will
 rise a few %!
 Letfs install it right away!h
(Click click click)
Happy Fukuda started fiddling with his creepy machine
while mumbling some nonsense.
hAlright, Ifm gonna start it up.
 Letfs do some floating point calculations!h
h.....??h
hOh, Ifve got the results!
 My data processing speed is 12.3% up with the Pintel
 486! Amazing!h
h.....What the fuck are you talking about?h
hWell, faster is better.
 Right, right??h
hHrmmm, I canft keep up with this loser.h
Happy Fukudafs tapping away at his computer like hefs
completely forgotten my existence.
hThis door again... shit.
 Canft we destroy it or something?h
hI donft think itfs possible if itfs this big,
 Rance-sama.h
hUmm...h
hWhat, is there something wrong?h
hWell, if youfd like, I could open it?h
hWhat?h
hThis door can be opened.
 I checked it out.h
hAlright, try it.h
hYes.h
hThis part... and then spin this.. umm.h
Merimfs messing with the device.
hShefs kind of amazing, Rance-sama.h
hWell she said she was an archaeologist with the Helman
 Army, right? They brought her for this kinda shit,
 right?h
hShefs completely useless in combat, but it looks like
 shefll come in handy in unexpected places.h
hUmm.. Ifve unlocked it.
 Should I open it now?h
hAlright, do it.h
hUnderstood.
 *Click*.h
(Rumble)
The door opened.
hI did it! Merimfs so happy!h
hLa la la!h
