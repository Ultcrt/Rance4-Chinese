ÅhAlright, do it.Åh

The door opened.
ÅhAlright, weÅfre goinÅf in.Åh
The door is locked (and requires the Iron Hanny Key).
Used the Iron Hanny Key to open the door.
The door cannot be opened.
The door cannot be opened.
ÅhRance-sama, it looks like this transport device is
 one-way, so we canÅft use it from this side.Åh
ÅhSo this is the last stop.
 Then how the hell are we supposed to get back?Åh
ÅhI think there must be another transport device somewhere
 else to get back, but if it comes to it, we can always
 use a Return Bonsai, so we should be okay.Åh
ÅhI guess youÅfre right.Åh
The door is locked (and requires the Belief Key).
Used the Belief Key to open the door.
The door cannot be opened.
The door is locked (and requires the Betrayal Key).

The door wonÅft open.
The door wonÅft open.
ÅhOh, somethingÅfs there!Åh
ÅhWhat?Åh
Kanami found something like a sword in the darkness.
ÅhItÅfs a naginata.Åh
Obtained Naginata.
The door was shut tight and wouldnÅft open.
It seems like itÅfs locked, but I donÅft see a keyhole.
ÅhRance-sama, what should we do?Åh
ÅhIÅfve gotta lift this door, right?Åh
I stuck my hands in the gap underneath the door and
pulled up, hard.
(Clatter)
The surprisingly light door opened like a shutter.
ÅhWe did it, Rance-sama!Åh
ÅhWhat a ridiculous door.Åh
ÅhAlright, IÅfm gonna push it.Åh
(Hrmm hrmm push push)
ÅhItÅfs not budging, huh, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhI guess itÅfs not a push door.Åh
ÅhAlright, IÅfm gonna pull it.Åh
(Hrmm hrmm pull pull)
ÅhItÅfs not moving at all, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhSeems like itÅfs not a pull door either.Åh
ÅhFor the time being, I guess IÅfll knock politely.
 I AM a gentleman, after all.Åh
I stood at attention and knocked properly.
(Knock knock knock)
Åh........Åh
Åh.........Åh
(Knock knock knock)
Åh..........Åh
ÅhIt doesnÅft look like anyoneÅfs home, Rance-sama.Åh
So they wonÅft come out even though IÅfM going to the
trouble of knocking..
... ÅhWho visits the kingÅfs summer resort??Åh
ÅhWhoÅfre you??Åh
All of a sudden, a Science was standing behind me.
Science ÅhLooks like an uninvited guest.
         IÅfll have to punish you, taah..!Åh
ÅhRance-sama, thereÅfs a sign?
 Sould we read it?Åh

ÅhLetÅfs see??Åh
ÅhWhere are we going, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhWeÅfre goinÅf to the Control Room where Bitch or whatever
 is. You know that.Åh
ÅhBut then, we shouldnÅft use this...Åh
ÅhI know that.
 I was joking. Hmph.Åh
ÅhAlright, letÅfs go!Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
We stood in the center of the magic circle on the ground.
Moving to Tousho Core
.........
ÅhWhat?
 WeÅfre back in town!?Åh
ÅhIt looks like that transport device is there to return
 to the outside, Rance-sama.Åh
Ascend stairs?
Ascending to higher floor.
Descend stairs?
Descending to lower floor.
DoesnÅft look like thereÅfs any reason to search thoroughly
here.
ÅhKyaaaaa!Åh
ÅhHm, a scream?Åh
ÅhAnd itÅfs a womanÅfs scream too.. letÅfs go, Sill.Åh
ÅhYes, Rance-sama.Åh
I ran towards the screams.
ÅhOh, look at this!!!Åh
ÅhRance-sama, a girl is being attacked by a monster!Åh
ÅhWhat, a monsterÅfs being attacked by a girl?Åh
ÅhNo, the girl is being attacked.Åh
ÅhHm, hm.Åh
... ÅhKyaaaa, help me..!!Åh
Ohh, a girl with exposed skin is being attacked by a Nubobo.
Sill ÅhRance-sama, we should save... eh?Åh
I grabbed SillÅfs hand and shook my head.
Rance ÅhA beautiful girl is being attacked by a monster here.
       We should observe until sheÅfs just about to get done in.Åh
Sill ÅhRance-sama...Åh
Rance ÅhDonÅft worry, I wonÅft let a good woman like that get killed by
       a monster. IÅfll save her right at the last minute.
       But man, this is dirty.Åh
The Nubobo is attacking the girl with bloodshot eyes.
Nubobo ÅhOhohohohohooon.Åh
Girl ÅhKyaaaa, no!
      DonÅft do anything weird!!Åh
The Nubobo uses its large hands to violently grope the beautyÅfs
breasts and uses its tail to lewdly stroke the beautyÅfs secret place.
Girl Åh..Kuh.. *gasp*.. AAaah..!Åh
Nubobo ÅhOhohohohohohohoon!
        Duh you like dat?Åh
Girl Åh......Åh
The beautyÅfs ignoring him, but from how wet she is..
She likes it.
This is nice.. I wanna go over there and stick my destructive weapon
into that wet pussy.
Nubobo ÅhOhohohohoon.
        I canÅft take dis anymore.Åh
Girl Åh.........................Åh
Nubobo ÅhOoh, good, good.Åh
Girl Åh.........................Åh
Sill ÅhRance-sama, that girl is whispering something to the monster.Åh
Rance ÅhI bet sheÅfs saying something like ÅfI canÅft take it anymore,
       just put it in alreadyÅf.Åh
Sill ÅhIt doesnÅft really look like that though...Åh
The NuboboÅfs eyes became more bloodshot and it started attacking
harder.
Girl ÅhOh, enough already!!Åh
Girl ÅhThunderstrike!!Åh
Powerful lightning struck the Nubobo and it was blown
away.
ÅhWhat the hell? She defeated the monster on her own!Åh
ÅhBut Rance-sama, it looks like sheÅfs unconscious.
 LetÅfs go help her.Åh
ÅhYes, I guess so.Åh
ÅhHelping people.. helping people.. helping ladies...Åh
(Walk walk)
I sat the woman up and held her.
My hand accidentally touched her seductive skin, but it
just happened, so itÅfs not like I could have done
anything to avoid it.. Ufufufu.
ÅhHey, you okay?Åh
ÅhTh.. thank you.Åh
ÅhDonÅft worry, I completely destroyed that evil monster.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, she defeated the...Åh
ÅhShut up.Åh
Åh.....Åh
ÅhThank you very much.
 My name is Io Ishtar.Åh
ÅhI came to this dungeon to pick bamboo shoots, but I was
 attacked by a monster that appeared out of nowhere...Åh
ÅhI see, that must have been terrible.Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
ÅhWell then, letÅfs get down to business.Åh
ÅhIÅfm not an honorable hero of justice doing charity work.
 Got it?Åh
ÅhOf course. The world isnÅft so convenient as that.Åh
ÅhYou want me to thank you for saving me, right?Åh
ÅhRight, you understand well.
 IÅfm a nice guy, so if you donÅft have any money....Åh
ÅhPlease allow me to thank you.Åh
Io stared into my eyes.
Åh.........Åh
ÅhIn thanks, IÅfll give you.. everything.Åh
Åh..........Åh
Åh..........Åh
Åh....Okay.Åh
ÅhRance-san, youÅfll do me a favor, wonÅft you?Åh
ÅhY.. yeah.Åh
IÅfll listen to any request from my beloved Io.
ÅhRance-sama, Rance-sama...!Åh
ÅhWhat did you do to Rance-sama!!?Åh
ÅhI didnÅft really do anything.Åh
ÅhThatÅfs a lie.... You cast a spell, you cast a Charm
 spell on Rance-sama!Åh
ÅhThatÅfs right, I did. Fufufu..
 Why donÅft you undo it then? That is, if you can.Åh
ÅhRelease the spell, and release Rance-sama right now!
 If you donÅft, IÅfll.. IÅfll defeat you!Åh
ÅhHmm..? I see.Åh
ÅhRance-saaan, that Sill girlÅfs being mean to me!Åh
Io suddenly started crying and clung to Rance.
ÅhWhat!? Sill is?Åh
ÅhNo, Rance-sama! Rance-sama, that girl cast a spell on
 you..!Åh
ÅhShut up! YouÅfre just a slave, youÅfve got no right to lay
 a hand on my beloved!Åh
(Hit hit hit hit)
Åh.....Rance-sama!Åh
ÅhGot it, Sill?
 DonÅft do anything to Io anymore. Got it?Åh
ÅhIo, I scolded Sill, so please forgive her.Åh
ÅhThatÅfs fine. Thank you.
 My beloved Rance-san.Åh
ÅhGahahahahahahaha... IÅfm so embarrassed!Åh
ÅhRance-sama.. no waaay..!Åh
ÅhHey, Rance-san.
 Could you please do me a favor?Åh
ÅhSure. IÅfd do anything for you, Io.Åh
ÅhI want you to find a key for me.Åh
ÅhA key... A key, huh?Åh
ÅhYeah, there are four keys hidden somewhere in this
 Toushin Toshi.
 I need them.. Rance-san.Åh
ÅhI got it. If itÅfs for you, IÅfll look for these keys.Åh
ÅhReally, Rance-san? Thank you!
 I love you!Åh
Io joined the party.
ÅhAlright, letÅfs go.Åh
ÅhPlease do your best, Rance-san!
 But...Åh
ÅhWhat is it?Åh
ÅhDo your best in bed tonight, too.
 *Giggle* *giggle*.Åh
ÅhIn bed... whoa, of course.Åh
ÅhThis is it, right, Rick?Åh
ÅhYes.
 We landed down this path and through the third warp
 device from the left.Åh
ÅhThe third from the left... If I remember correctly,
 thatÅfs...Åh
ÅhThe door was locked and we couldnÅft open it.Åh
ÅhWe unlocked it from the inside, so it should be open.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, letÅfs hurry.
 LetÅfs hurry and save everyone!Åh
ÅhI guess so.
 They ARE all my women, I suppose.
 I guess I gotta take care of Åfem.Åh
ÅhJulia doesnÅft wanna go back there.
 ItÅfs scary.Åh
ÅhRance-san, letÅfs just defeat the weak monsters around
 here and play.Åh
ÅhNah, we canÅft.
 I mean, IÅfm a hero of justice, you know.
 IÅfve gotta save ladies in trouble.Åh
ÅhI knew youÅfd say that, Rance-dono.
 Now, letÅfs go.Åh
ÅhKuh, kuh, hee, hee, hee.Åh
ÅhItÅfs Happy Fukuda-san, Rance-sama.
 I wonder what heÅfs doing?Åh
ÅhHey, gloomy freak.Åh
(Punt)
I gave Happy Fukuda a kick in the head as he squatted and
messed with his computer.
ÅhOww, what was that for!?Åh
ÅhHey, whatcha doinÅf?Åh
ÅhI was using my computer.
 ItÅfs got nothing to do with you.Åh
Åh........Åh
ÅhGuess I bothered you.Åh
Åh......Hm??Åh
ÅhRance-sama, something smells.Åh
The area was filled with an unpleasant stench.
ÅhGross, this.. this smells like somebody who hasnÅft taken
 a bath in a while.Åh
ÅhYes, it smells pretty bad.
 I wonder if thereÅfs someone living here?Åh
ÅhProbably.Åh
(Beeb-boop)
ÅhRance-sama, what was that noise?Åh
ÅhWhoÅfs there!!?Åh
I spun to face the direction the noise had come from.
ÅhAh.. WhoÅfs there?
 YouÅfre being a bit louder than IÅfd like.Åh
A man who was nothing but skin and bones sat there in
ragged clothes.
By the manÅfs feet are a bunch of weird, blinking machines
in the middle of a mess of wires.
ÅhWhat the heckÅfre you?
 What are you doing in here?Åh
ÅhIÅfm Happy Fukuda.
 Oh, donÅft step there.Åh
ÅhHuh? Owah!Åh
ÅhThese are valuable gilt cables.
 TheyÅfre expensive, geez.
 If you break them, youÅfll have to reimburse me.Åh
....What the hell is this weird spindly guy..?
Happy Fukuda? Oh.. Right, I remember now.
DidnÅft the item shop girl Yocchan ask me to give
something to this guy?
ÅhHey, I got something IÅfm supposed to give you.
 You want this?Åh
I took out the Pintel 486.
ÅhOh, thatÅfs a [Pintel 486]!!
 ThatÅfs great, IÅfm so lucky!Åh
I handed the Pintel 486 over to Fukuda.
ÅhAnyway, IÅfve delivered it.
 So what is that thing??Åh
ÅhThis iiiis...Åh
ÅhA part that increases a computerÅfs processing speed!Åh
ÅhFufufufufufu, now my computerÅfs processing speed will
 rise a few %!
 LetÅfs install it right away!Åh
(Click click click)
Happy Fukuda started fiddling with his creepy machine
while mumbling some nonsense.
ÅhAlright, IÅfm gonna start it up.
 LetÅfs do some floating point calculations!Åh
Åh.....??Åh
ÅhOh, IÅfve got the results!
 My data processing speed is 12.3% up with the Pintel
 486! Amazing!Åh
Åh.....What the fuck are you talking about?Åh
ÅhWell, faster is better.
 Right, right??Åh
ÅhHrmmm, I canÅft keep up with this loser.Åh
Happy FukudaÅfs tapping away at his computer like heÅfs
completely forgotten my existence.
ÅhThis door again... shit.
 CanÅft we destroy it or something?Åh
ÅhI donÅft think itÅfs possible if itÅfs this big,
 Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhUmm...Åh
ÅhWhat, is there something wrong?Åh
ÅhWell, if youÅfd like, I could open it?Åh
ÅhWhat?Åh
ÅhThis door can be opened.
 I checked it out.Åh
ÅhAlright, try it.Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
ÅhThis part... and then spin this.. umm.Åh
MerimÅfs messing with the device.
ÅhSheÅfs kind of amazing, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhWell she said she was an archaeologist with the Helman
 Army, right? They brought her for this kinda shit,
 right?Åh
ÅhSheÅfs completely useless in combat, but it looks like
 sheÅfll come in handy in unexpected places.Åh
ÅhUmm.. IÅfve unlocked it.
 Should I open it now?Åh
ÅhAlright, do it.Åh
ÅhUnderstood.
 *Click*.Åh
(Rumble)
The door opened.
ÅhI did it! MerimÅfs so happy!Åh
ÅhLa la la!Åh
