hBitch-sama, the Toushin Toshi Search System is showing a
 response. Itfs intruders.h
hWhat? Let me see.h
hHere.h
hItfs a treasure chest!h
hCan you open it, àó—˜ˆŸ?h
hItfs fine. I can do at least this much.h
(Rustle rustle)
I investigated the treasure chest a little bit, but it
didnft look trapped.
hIfm opening it.h
(Creeeeak)
The treasure chest opened with a painful screeching
noise.
hIs there something inside??h
hYeah, a key... Itfs a key.
 Umm, it has fW Keyf written on it.h
hI wonder what a W Key opens?h
hIt looks like it was pretty carefully constructed, and
 considering how it was hidden like this, it could be
 pretty important.h
... hThatfs correct, ladies.h
hWhofs there!!?h
We all turned together to the direction the voice had
come from.
hKyaaaa, kyaaaaa!h
hKyaaaaa, kyaaaaa!h
hKyaaaaa, kyaaaaaa!h
hY- youfre a loud one.h
héä»‰ë!!h
hThe Helman Army, huh? Cowards.h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!h
hOh, donft move now.
 Even simpletons like you can figure out whatfll happen
 to this noisy girl if you move, right?h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!h
hKuh...!h
hNow then, I happen to need that key youfre holding.
 Could you kindly hand it over?h
h.........h
hYou, the mage. Take the key and come over here by
 yourself.h
hWhoa there.
 Donft think about doing anything stupid.h
hDens here isnft too bright, but hefs a strong one.
 He just needs to squeeze a little bit and this girlfll
 be squished, just like that.h
hKyaaaaa, kyaaaaa,
 Ifm gonna diiie, Ifm gonna diiiie!h
This is no good, he doesnft have any openings.
If we try to do something and screw up, hefll really kill
éä»‰ë-chan.
The Helman Army is a bunch of cowards.. how could they do
this?
hIfll go, àó—˜ˆŸ.h
hYou canft, Shizuka!
 Itfs a trap!h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!
 Mage girl, hurry up and bring me the W Key.h
hThatfs that. Ifve gotta do it.h
hShizuka....h
hI got it, Helman soldiers.
 Ifm going over there right now, so donft lay a hand on
 that girl.h
hKehya, kehya!h
Shizuka took the W Key in her hand and advanced slowly.
hIfm a failure as a leader.
 I donft know what to do in a situation like this!h
hàó—˜ˆŸ-san, nothing will come of you worrying right now.
 Donft give up yet, just wait.h
Shizuka finished crossing the bridge.
hKehya, kehya, kehya!h
h.....What a creep.h
hDonft get sassy with me, brat.h
h‹x”Œ“Á, tie this girl up.h
h...Sorry.h
hHmph, Helman dog.h
‹x”Œ“Á tied Shizuka up so that she couldnft move.
hLet go of éä»‰ë.
 You promised, didnft you?h
hEven Helman people can keep promises, canft they?h
hKehya, kehya, but of course.
 Hey, Dens.
 Get off of there and come over here.h
hGet off of.. but..
 Wait a second, if he does that...h
hIf, if I, move, w- wonft the, bridge, fall?h
hKehya, kehya, I donft care.
 Let that girl go.h
hKyaaaa, Ifm scared, Ifm scared!h
When Dens released éä»‰ë, she ran back over to åQf,
screaming.
hNooo, stop!h
When Dens stepped off of the pedestal, the bridge fell.
hKyaaaa!!!h
hUwah..!h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!
 They all fell quite nicely.h
hCoward!!h
hFufufufu, Ifm going to put you to work for me from now
 on.h
h........h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!h
