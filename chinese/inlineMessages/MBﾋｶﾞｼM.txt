...A monster attacked.
Leave the room?
Descend stairs?
Descending to lower floor.
ÅhRance-sama, thereÅfs a treasure chest.
 What should I do?Åh
ÅhI feel like itÅfll explode if you open it.
 Leave it alone.Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
ÅhAlright, open it.Åh
ÅhUnderstood.Åh
ÅhHurry up and open it.
 Quickly now. Eliminate all unnecessary time spent and
 shorten the process.Åh
ÅhItÅfs open, Rance-sama!Åh
ÅhRance-sama, I foundÅF 
 inside.Åh
ÅhIÅfll hold onto it.Åh
There should be a Tokko-chan hiding somewhere around
here.
ÅhAre you here!!?Åh
I looked under the desk, but she wasnÅft there.
ItÅfs a normal desk.
There should be a Tokko-chan hiding somewhere around
here.
ÅhAre you here!!?Åh
I opened the bookcase, but there was nothing but books
inside.
ItÅfs a bookcase.
There are books like ÅhAutomobiles for Kids,Åh ÅhFighter
Jets for Kids,Åh and ÅhFrench for KidsÅh inside.
There should be a Tokko-chan hiding somewhere around
here.
ÅhThereÅfs no point in hiding!Åh
(Clack)
I opened the closet.
Tokko-chan ÅhKyaaaa!Åh
ÅhI found you!Åh
Tokko ÅhNo, stop, stop it!
       DonÅft kill me!!Åh
ÅhIÅfm not gonna kill you!
 I just wanna play!Åh
I embraced the Tokko-chan and stuck my raging hyper
weapon right into her.
Tokko ÅhIt hurts.. Mommy, help me!!Åh
ÅhGahahahahaha...!
 It only hurts in the beginning!Åh
But thereÅfs blood coming out of the Tokko-chanÅfs pussy
where my huge thing is in her, so I bet it hurts a lot...
It feels great for me though, so I donÅft really care.
(Ram ram ram)
Tokko ÅhAaaah, aaah!Åh
(Ram ram ram ram spurt!)
...........
.............
ItÅfs a normal closet.
There should be a Tokko-chan hiding somewhere around
here.
ÅhAre you here!!?Åh
I looked under the table, but she wasnÅft there.
ItÅfs a normal table.
There should be a Tokko-chan hiding somewhere around
here.
ÅhI know youÅfre hiding in here!
 Come on out!Åh
I looked under the bed, but the Tokko-chan wasnÅft hiding
there.
ItÅfs a cute bed.
ItÅfs a cupboard with a bunch of medicine and bandages and
stuff in it.
ThereÅfs nothing particularly strange about it.
ItÅfs a shelf with a bunch of medicine on it.
There are a bunch of mysterious drugs.
There are two large beakers, one with [Heated Glass]
written on it, the other with [Monkeytic].
ÅhOh, this is Heated Glass, one of the things I need for
 my Tulip #1Åfs power up.Åh
ÅhHow nice! IÅfll just take this.Åh
Obtained Heated Glass.
ItÅfs a bookcase packed with books.
ÅhKuh, they all look like complicated books that arenÅft
 fun at all.Åh
Just a normal table.
ThereÅfs nothing particularly strange about it.
ÅhRance-sama, thereÅfs some kind of note here.Åh
ÅhUmm... It says...
 Misly.. so.. Caren??
 ......
 Re-plica....Åh
ÅhI canÅft really read this ancient script...Åh
ÅhHm? Lemme see.Åh
ÅhOh, itÅfs a cute girl!
 Was she auditioning for something?Åh
ThereÅfs a bottle of something or other in this cupboard.
ÅhSill, find anything valuable?Åh
ÅhHmm.. not really.
 It looks like a bunch of experimental drugs and bandages
 and things like that.Åh
Just a normal desk.
Hmmm, not something thatÅfd come in handy for me right
now.
ThereÅfs a large stone table.
ÅhThis is an operating table, Rance-sama.
 ItÅfs something doctors use.Åh
ÅhSo itÅfs a table doctors and nurses use to have fun on,
 huh..?Åh
ÅhI think itÅfs actually for operations....Åh
ItÅfs a shabby bed.
ÅhMan, I get really excited when I see beds.
 I wonder why.Åh
ÅhYeah, like right around my hips here.
 Right, Sill?Åh
ÅhI.. I donÅft know.Åh
ItÅfs a model of the human body. How creepy.
ÅhItÅfs kind of creepy, isnÅft it, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhCreepy? YouÅfd look just like this with your skin peeled
 off, you know.Åh
Åh.....Åh
ÅhWhatÅfs this hole??Åh
There was a hole that looked like it was probably there
for a reason in the middle of the room, but when I looked
down it, I couldnÅft see anything. ItÅfs pretty deep.
ÅhWait, thereÅfs something there!Åh
ÅhYou see something, Kanami?
 ItÅfs pitch black.Åh
ÅhDonÅft underestimate a ninjaÅfs eyes. I train every day to
 be able to see long-distance, you know.Åh
ÅhWow, thatÅfs amazing, Kanami-san.Åh
ÅhSo what do you see?Åh
ÅhThereÅfs something like a gem stuck in the wall part of
 the way down this hole.Åh
ÅhWhat? Something valuable?Åh
ÅhLooks like.
 I think I can reach it.Åh
Kanami hooked her legs around the railing and reached
down into the hole.
ÅhUgh... cÅfmon, cÅfmon, just a bit more...Åh
I gingerly touched KanamiÅfs defenseless butt.
Åh.....Kya!Åh
ÅhHowÅfs it going, Kanami? Did you get it?Åh
ÅhGeez, donÅft touch my butt!
 I couldÅfve fallen!Åh
ÅhGahahahahaha, itÅfs a nice, pretty butt.Åh
ÅhGeez. Here.
 I got it.Åh
Kanami handed a diamond to me.
Obtained Diamond.
An expensive-looking mageÅfs staff, the Flame Staff, is
stuck in the ground.
ÅhOhh, itÅfs just sitting there like Åfplease take me,Åf
 isnÅft it?Åh
ÅhBut this must be a trap, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhAlright, IÅfm gonna take it.Åh
I grabbed the Flame Staff and pulled.
(Zap) Something like electricity passed from the grip
through my hand and into my body.
RanceÅfs experience became 0.
Åh....Fucking hell!!
 What a clever trap!Åh
I got caught in the clever trap and lost experience.
ÅhSill, itÅfs a weapon for a mage.
 You pull it out.Åh
ÅhOkay.Åh
Sill grabbed the Flame StaffÅfs handle and..
ÅhKya!Åh
Sill fell onto her butt.
A mysterious light passed from the staff through her hand
and around her body.
SillÅfs experience became 0.
Åh*Sob* *sob*, Rance-sama!
 I lost all my experience!Åh
ÅhRance-sama, we have to undo the sealing magic on this
 staff to take it.Åh
ÅhGrab that staff, Io.Åh
ÅhNo way, itÅfs probably trapped.
 Make Sill-chan take it.Åh
Åh....I guess youÅfre right.Åh
Use which item?
ÅhAlright, itÅfs probably fine to touch it with these
 Rubber Gloves.Åh
Åh...........Åh
ÅhYouÅfd better not be doubting me, Sill.
 My plans are perfect.Åh
ÅhOf course not.
 I think itÅfs a good idea.Åh
ÅhRight? This Flame Staff has some kind of weird power in
 its handle, but if you protect yourself with these
 Rubber Gloves, youÅfll be fine!
 Gahahahahahahaha!Åh
ÅhSo, Sill.
 Use the Rubber Gloves and take it.Åh
ÅhYes, Rance-sama.Åh
Sill put the Rubber Gloves on and grabbed the Flame Staff
timidly.
Åh.........Åh
ÅhHuh? NothingÅfs happening.
 Rance-sama, the Rubber Gloves really undid the seal on
 the staff.Åh
ÅhGahahahahahahaha, of course! It was my idea after all!Åh
ÅhWow, Rance-sama, youÅfre amazing!Åh
The Rubber Gloves disintigrated and became useless, but I
managed to obtain the Flame Staff safely.
ÅhRance-sama, how are you going to use that
?Åh
Åh......Never mind.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, do you think thereÅfs a hidden passageway
 behind this bookcase?Åh
ÅhAlright, Sill.
 Try and move it.Åh
ÅhOkay, IÅfll try.Åh
ÅhHeave-ho, heave-ho.Åh
ItÅfs a small device with four buttons on it.
ÅhWell, it looks safe enough, so letÅfs try pushing
 something.Åh
There are four buttons, so which should I push?
I pushed the purple button.
  (Push)
I pushed the blue button.
  (Push)
I pushed the black button.
  (Push)
I pushed the red button.
  (Push)
Åh........Åh
ÅhWhatÅfs wrong, Rance-sama?
 YouÅfre not going to push one?Åh
ÅhNah.Åh
ÅhWhat the heckÅfs this machine?
 There are four buttons. Well, might as well push one,
 right?Åh
ÅhNo, Rance-san!Åh
ÅhHm...?Åh
(Push) ÅÉÅ|Pushed a button.
ÅhThatÅfs a device to destroy the world!
 If you push that, the world will be enveloped in dark
 flames and everything will return to nothing!Åh
ÅhAck, are you serious..? Eeee!!
 I already pushed it!!!Åh
ÅhKyaaa, Rance-sama..! Geez..!Åh
ÅhMy worldÅfs gonna be destroyed.. If I had known this was
 gonna happen, IÅfd have slept with more womeeeeen..!Åh
ÅhI lied.Åh
ÅhEh??Åh
ÅhI lied. You actually thought that was the truth?Åh
Åh.........Åh
ÅhRance-sama, thereÅfs some kind of note.Åh
I picked up the note on top of the desk.
ÅhLetÅfs see here.....Åh
ÅFReactivating an Under Repair Tousho          ÅF
ÅF To reactivate a Tousho that is under repair,ÅF
ÅF provide its brain with magic energy.        ÅF
ÅF Over 20 magic is required.                  ÅF
ÅFTousho Energy                                ÅF
ÅF Tousho can function almost indefinitely     ÅF
ÅF without food. However, most requre periodic ÅF
ÅF magic injection from a technician.          ÅF
ÅFOrdering a Tousho                            ÅF
ÅF The Toushin has absolute authority to give  ÅF
ÅF Tousho orders, but they normally cannot     ÅF
ÅF disobey orders from us mages either.        ÅF
...
ÅhItÅfs just boring shit.Åh
ÅhItÅfs probably a note written by someone researching or
 studying these ÅfToushoÅf.Åh
ThereÅfs a small hole in the wall.
ÅhAlright, IÅfm gonna spy on Ran-chan again.
 Fufufu, she might be changing or something right now!Åh
I peered into the small hole.
(Staaaaaaaaaaaaare)
ÅhRance-sama.. can you see anything?Åh
Åh...........Åh
Åh......ItÅfs pitch black.Åh
Clicking my tongue in annoyance, I gave up on looking
through the hole.
ÅhShit, I couldnÅft see anything.
 Sill, make it so that I can see naked Ran.Åh
ÅhI canÅft, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhShut up, do it, do it, do it, do it!!Åh
ÅhRance-samaaa.. I caaanÅft..!Åh
ÅhWell fine, then YOU get naked.Åh
ÅhBut Rance-sama, why?Åh
ÅhShut it.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, thereÅfs a hole in the wall.Åh
ÅhHow suspicious.. It might be a trap.Åh
ÅhThis is a dangerous one. It could shoot an arrow or spew
 poisonous gas if you look into it.Åh
ÅhThatÅfs scary, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhYeah, but.. I could see something nice.
 ThereÅfs a saying that goes Åfnothing ventured, nothing
 gainedÅf.Åh
ÅhDÅfyou know what it means, Sill?Åh
ÅhYes, it means that you wonÅft obtain anything if you
 donÅft act knowing it could be dangerous.Åh
ÅhRight.Åh
ÅhThereÅfs the danger of overlooking some kind of amazing
 discovery if we donÅft look into this hole.Åh
ÅhI.. I suppose...Åh
ÅhAlright, Sill.
 Do it.Åh
ÅhBut.. Rance-sama, IÅfm scared!Åh
ÅhDo it.Åh
ÅhRance-samaaa..!Åh
Sill looks at me as if pleading.
ÅhSill, do it.Åh
Åh...Okay.Åh
Trembling.. Sill looked into the hole.
Åh.........Åh
ÅhWhat is it? DÅfyou see something?Åh
Åh....Huh??Åh
ÅhWhat is it??
 What do you see??Åh
Åh....Well.. Ran-san...Åh
ÅhWhat!? Ran!!?
 Get outta my way!Åh
I shoved Sill aside and swiftly looked into the hole.
ÅhLetÅfs see...Åh
Oh... ItÅfs Ran...!
...........
Ran ÅhPhew... IÅfm tired.Åh
Ran ÅhKathtomÅfs budget deficit is at its limit, huh..
     Oh.. This is terrible.Åh
Looks like RanÅfs doing some accounting in Kathtom.
Ran Åh...WeÅfd be bankrupt if not for Maria and Shizuka
     earning some money in Leazas.Åh
Ran ÅhHm...? Is, is someone there...?Åh
Ran glanced around as if sheÅfd become aware of my gaze.
Ran ÅhNo oneÅfs there... right?
     It must just be my imagination.Åh
ÅhI can see Ran. WhatÅfs going on?Åh
ÅhYes, I donÅft really understand, but here and there must
 be connected somehow....Åh
ÅhHmmm, if it were gonna connect somewhere, it coulda
 connected to like a bath or something. Too bad.Åh
ThereÅfs a mysterious blue sphere floating.
ÅhWhat the heckÅfs this sphere?Åh
ÅhKyan, a ghost..!!Åh
Åh........Åh
ÅhBoo..!Åh
ÅhNooo, IÅfm scared, IÅfm scaaared!Åh
Åh..........Åh
ÅhBoo...!Åh
Åh..........Åh
ÅhB...Åh
Åh...Fufufufufu, youÅfre pretty cute.Åh
Åh.....Åh
ÅhLet me do youuuuu!!Åh
I tried to pounce on the ghost but I just went straight
through her.
ÅhUwah.. whoops.. what the?Åh
Åh...Umm, are you okay?Åh
ÅhTch, sheÅfs got no body Åfcause sheÅfs a ghost..
 so we canÅft do it?Åh
ÅhRance-sama, youÅfll be possessed if you do something like
 that.Åh
ÅhUmm....Åh
ÅhHow could I have sex if I worried about every little
 thing like that!?
 Where thereÅfs a will, thereÅfs a way!Åh
ÅhUmm....Åh
ÅhRance-san, the ghostÅfs trying to talk to us.
 Why donÅft we hear what she has to say?Åh
ÅhI guess so.
 What do you want to say, Ghost I CanÅft Fuck?Åh
ÅhAre you... not a mage?Åh
ÅhOf course not.
 Io here and my slave Sill are mages though.Åh
ÅhIÅfm a famous warrior.Åh
ÅhOh good, so youÅfre not someone from the Sect?Åh
ÅhSect? I dunno what that is, so no.Åh
ÅhPlease help me pass on.Åh
ÅhHahahahaha, I thought this would happen.Åh
ÅhYou did? What do you mean, Rance-san?Åh
ÅhIf a ghost appears, youÅfre always gonna end up helping
 it pass on, right?Åh
ÅhThis stuffÅfs painfully easy to predict when youÅfve been
 adventuring as long as I have.Åh
Åh....IÅfm sorry.Åh
ÅhWhatever.
 Why donÅft you tell me about yourself?Åh
ÅhSo youÅfll help me pass on?
 Thank you so much.Åh
ÅhNah, itÅfs not like IÅfve decided.
 IÅfll decide after you talk.Åh
Åh...Okay.Åh
ÅhMy name is Naturi Dora.
 I used to live in Rukra Village.Åh
ÅhNaturi-chan, eh? So what happened to you?Åh
Åh........Åh
ÅhWhat is it? Hurry up and tell me.Åh
ÅhWell, it happened hundreds of years ago, so I forgot.Åh
ÅhYou forgot!!?
 Well what are we supposed to do then?Åh
ÅhRance-san, letÅfs leave this ghost alone and go find my
 keys.Åh
ÅhYeah, we probably should.Åh
ÅhP.. please wait.Åh
ÅhPlease help me pass on.
 IÅfll give you a key as thanks.Åh
ÅhWhat? A key?
 Is it one weÅfre looking for?Åh
ÅhI donÅft know, but it could be.Åh
ÅhFine, if youÅfll give us a key, IÅfll think about it.
 But first, show me this key.Åh
ÅhNo.Åh
ÅhWhaaat!?
 Just show it to me a little bit!Åh
ÅhIf I showed it to you, youÅfd just take it and run,
 right?
 I get the feeling thatÅfs what would happen.Åh
ÅhShe saw through you, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhShut it.Åh
(Hit hit hit hit)
Åh*Sob* *sob*.Åh
ÅhI got it. IÅfll try to find a way to make you pass on.Åh
ÅhThank you. IÅfm so happy.Åh
ÅhSo is there anything at all you remember?Åh
ÅhWell, it was hundreds of years ago...
 Although.. I remember being experimented on while I was
 alive.Åh
ÅhSad, painful memories..Åh
ÅhI just want to pass on soon.Åh
ÅhYeah. Leave it to me.Åh
ÅhHey, Naturi-san.
 You were experimented on, right?Åh
ÅhYes...Åh
ÅhHmmm? So then did they do a bunch of dirty stuff to
 you?Åh
Åh.....Åh
ÅhLike saying it was for an experiment and giving you
 electric shocks in you-know-where.....Åh
ÅhWhoa, thatÅfs super lewd!Åh
ÅhOr like calling it Åfreproductive researchÅf and making
 you have sex with monsters..?Åh
ÅhWhoa.. ThatÅfs so lewd!Åh
Åh...No, nothing like that.
 No, no...Åh
ÅhI donÅft think so....Åh
ÅhOh? You donÅft remember, so you canÅft deny it completely,
 can you?
 *Giggle* *giggle*.Åh
ÅhAahn, I just want to pass on soon!Åh
ÅhAahn, I just want to pass on soon!Åh
ÅhI just found something interesting in a cell back
 there.Åh
ÅhSomething interesting??
 What was it? What was it?Åh
ÅhIt was your corpse.Åh
Åh......Åh
ÅhYour corpse, chained cruelly and left to rot. Nothing
 but bones now.Åh
ÅhWaah, waah, my body..!
 Waah waah, waah, waah!Åh
ÅhShut up, stop crying!Åh
ÅhWaah, waah, waah, waah, waah,
 waah, waah, waah, waah!Åh
ÅhI mean, I found your body, so..
 you should be able to pass on now..Åh
ÅhWaah, waah, waah, waah, waah,
 waah, waah, waah, waah!Åh
ÅhSo...Åh
ÅhWaah, waah, waah, waah, waah,
 waah, waah, waah, waah!Åh
ÅhRance-sama, sheÅfs crying too much to hear anything
 youÅfre saying.Åh
Åh...SheÅfs like the fuckinÅf Dog Policeman.Åh
ÅhPlease help me....Åh
ÅhYeah, yeah. If I used this holy water, it should be
 easy.
 Just wait a little longer.Åh
ÅhThank you.Åh
ÅhWhen you pass on, you better gimme that key.
 DonÅft forget, okay?Åh
ÅhOf course. I wonÅft need it on the other side.
 IÅfll give it to you when IÅfve passed on.Åh
ItÅfs a weathered skeleton.
Åh...Just bones, huh? How pitiful.Åh
ÅhPlease rest in peace.Åh
ÅhSill, stop praying and check these bones out.Åh
ÅhEhhh?Åh
ÅhDonÅft complain, just figure out if thereÅfs anything
 valuable on Åfem.Åh
ÅhI donÅft want to.. Åfcause..
 IÅfm scared.Åh
ÅhStop complaining and just do it!Åh
Sill accepted her fate and investigated the skeleton.
ÅhI didnÅft find anything, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhSill, check for valuables.Åh
Åh...Yes.Åh
Sill started timidly examining the skeleton.
ÅhWell? Found anything?Åh
ÅhRance-sama, this skeleton... itÅfs a woman.
 ItÅfs wearing womenÅfs clothes.Åh
ÅhA woman, eh? CanÅft tell if she was cute or ugly. I guess
 itÅfs all the same once youÅfre like this.Åh
ÅhOh.....Åh
ÅhWhat? ÅfD you find something?Åh
ÅhRance-sama, do you think this skeleton is Naturi-san,
 the ghost from earlier?Åh
ÅhWhat?Åh
ÅhSheÅfs wearing the same clothes.Åh
ÅhHuh. I guess.. she is.Åh
ÅhHow terrible. She died in chains like this. She must
 have been too sad to pass on.Åh
ÅhI guess so.Åh
The ghost girlÅfs skeleton is tied in chains.
ÅhI feel sorry for her.Åh
ÅhThe question is how do we get her to pass on?
 Hmmm.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, why donÅft we go ask at the church?Åh
ÅhThe church??
 CynthiaÅfs church????Åh
ÅhYes.
 ItÅfs the only church in this town.
 The god is a little weird, but...
 Okay, maybe youÅfre right.Åh
ÅhHmmm, this is a difficult problem.Åh
ÅhOkay, this is the body, right?Åh
ÅhLetÅfs use the Holy Water, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhAlright.Åh
I took out the bottle of Holy Water, twisted off the cap,
and sprinkled the Holy Water on the skeleton.
(...........)
ÅhAhh, my body is so light.
 I donÅft feel bound anymore.Åh
ÅhThank you so much.Åh
ÅhYup, you better thank me 200,000 times.Åh
ÅhThank you. 1.Åh
ÅhThank you. 2.Åh
ÅhThank you. 3.Åh
ÅhThank you. 4.Åh
ÅhThank you. 5.Åh
ÅhThank you. 6.Åh
ÅhThank you. 7.Åh
ÅhThank you. 8.Åh
ÅhThank you. 9.Åh
ÅhYouÅfre annoying me. ThatÅfs enough.
 Do the last 199,991 in your head.Åh
ÅhOkay.Åh
ÅhThatÅfs great. You can pass on without any regrets now,
 right?Åh
Åh..........Åh
ÅhHm? What is it?Åh
Åh..........Åh
ÅhYou better not say youÅfve still got regrets or
 something.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, Naturi-san was subject to terrible
 experiments, remember? She could still hold a grudge or
 something about that...Åh
ÅhA grudge.. Is that it, Naturi?Åh
ÅhThatÅfs not it.
 ItÅfs not that at all.Åh
ÅhThen what is it?
 Make up your mind already.Åh
ÅhIÅfm ready to move on, but I do have one regret...Åh
ÅhIf itÅfs not a grudge, then what is it?Åh
ÅhThereÅfs one thing I want to experience.
 I.. I want to have sex.Åh
ÅhSex??Åh
ÅhI see, so that was it, well thatÅfs easy!
 IÅfll fuck you!Åh
I tried to embrace Naturi, but I just went through her.
ÅhWaah, I hate having no body!Åh
ÅhHmmm, no matter how great at sex I am, I canÅft really do
 anything if we canÅft touch.Åh
ÅhWaah, waah!Åh
ÅhIÅfve got a good idea, Rance-san.Åh
ÅhAn idea??Åh
ÅhYes, weÅfll give Naturi-san a body.Åh
ÅhBut how?Åh
ÅhJust possess that girl and have sex.Åh
Io pointed at Sill.
ÅhHeh? M.. me??Åh
ÅhYeah, itÅfs to help her pass on.
 You can put up with this for her, canÅft you?Åh
ÅhBut.. I...Åh
ÅhPlease?Åh
ÅhAlright, Sill.
 Lend her your body.Åh
Åh.............Åh
ÅhI told you to lend it to her!
 Are you not listening to my orders!?Åh
ÅhI.. I understand.Åh
ÅhThank you very much.Åh
Naturi turned into something like white mist and entered
SillÅfs body.
Hmm, this is kinda creepy.
Åh..This is me?
 It feels kind of strange having a body after all this
 time.Åh
ÅhWell, we donÅft have much time, so letÅfs get to it.Åh
ÅhItÅfs.. my first time, so please be gentle...Åh
ÅhDonÅft even worry about it. Your bodyÅfs not a virgin, so
 it wonÅft hurt at all.
 IÅfve even been cultivating it, so itÅfs probably pretty
 sensitive.
 YouÅfre pretty lucky that this is how your first timeÅfs
 gonna be.Åh
ÅhThen IÅfll leave it to you.Åh
ÅhLetÅfs go, Sill.. I mean, Naturi.
 IÅfll teach you what men are like!Åh
I embraced the embarrassed Sill (Naturi) and swiftly
stripped her.
ÅhAhn, no, IÅfm scared!Åh
IÅfm used to fucking SillÅfs body, but since itÅfs someone
else inside it, this is kind of strange.
This might be kind of hard.
ÅhDonÅft struggle, come on.Åh
I held down her body as she tried to get away and
attacked all of SillÅfs weak spots.
After a few of my attacks, Naturi seemed to change and,
finally, surrender.
ÅhAh.. ah.. ah.. *gasp*..
 My body feels.. strange.. weird..!Åh
ÅhI know 100% of the time where to touch to get Sill to
 respond.
 Come on, this is next.Åh
I stuck my finger into her ass and moved it around a
little, making SillÅfs body jump.
ÅhKyan!Åh
ÅhNow, we donÅft have much time, so letÅfs get to it.Åh
ÅhOh, okay.Åh
I grabbed SillÅfs hips and placed my raging destructive
weapon to her wet pussy.
ÅhW-wait a second!Åh
ÅhNope, not gonna.Åh
(Ram)
My meat sword went right into its personal scabbard.
ÅhAAAAAAaaaah!!Åh
ÅhHowÅfs that? Feels good, right?
 IÅfll make you feel even better next!Åh
I embraced SillÅfs body and shook my hips, beginning my
Mad Piston Attack.
..............
...............
ÅhThanks so much for the good time.
 Now I can rest in peace.Åh
ÅhYep, no problem.Åh
ÅhHere, this is the key I promised you.Åh
I received the Research Key.
ÅhThis is the wrong key!
 We donÅft need this one!Åh
ÅhWhat!?Åh
ÅhWell, goodbye.Åh
ÅhHey, wait, this is the wrong key!
 Gimme a different..!Åh
...........
ÅhTch, sheÅfs gone.Åh
ÅhSo this is really the wrong key, Io?Åh
ÅhYeah, I need the W Key, the E Key, the N Key, and the S
 Key.Åh
ÅhShit!Åh
ÅhBut Rance-sama, with this Research Key, we can explore a
 new place, so I think weÅfll be able to find them now.Åh
Åh.........Åh
ÅhLetÅfs do our best, Rance-sama.Åh
Åh.............Åh
ÅhRance-sama, thereÅfs a weird ball on the desk.Åh
I casually picked up the ball.
It was a perfectly circular ball, 10 cm in diameter.
I dunno what the hell itÅfs made of.
ÅhWhat do you think this ball is, Io?Åh
ÅhThatÅfs Uppii shit.
 It looks pink and pretty, but....Åh
ÅhACK, shit!!?
 Gross!Åh
I tossed the ball to Sill.
ÅhNo, eww!Åh
ÅhI lied.Åh
ÅhHeh??Åh
ÅhWell of course it was a lie.
 The truth is I donÅft know what it is either.Åh
ÅhRance-sama!Åh
ÅhShut up! What do you want?Åh
ÅhIf you look really close, you can see letters on this
 pink ball.Åh
ÅhWhat?Åh
I took the ball from Sill and spun it around, looking for
the letters, and sure enough, there they were.
ÅhLetÅfs see. It says ÅfThis is an Antidote Ball. Any idiot
 can use it to instantly cure poisonÅf.Åh
ÅhHmm, an Antidote Ball, eh?
 Think we can use it over where that poisonous mist is?Åh
ÅhProbably. Anyway, letÅfs take it.Åh
Obtained Antidote Ball.
ÅhWhat the heckÅfs this??Åh
ÅhItÅfs a robot, Rance-sama! A robot!Åh
ÅhRobot??Åh
ÅhYes, IÅfve heard about them from Maria-san.
 TheyÅfre unliving things made with iron mechanisms.Åh
ÅhI donÅft get it at all.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, this....Åh
ÅhYeah, this must be one of those Tou-slow guys from that
 note.Åh
ÅhYou mean Tousho, Rance-sama.Åh
Åh....Right, Tousho.Åh
ÅhWanna try moving it, Rance-san?Åh
ÅhMoving it??Åh
ÅhYeah, Tousho are fighting weapons thatÅfll listen to any
 order. It could be a good subordinate for us.Åh
ÅhI see. It looks pretty strong, so itÅfs probably way more
 useful than Sill.Åh
ÅhYeah, yeah.
 That note said that they couldnÅft disobey orders,
 right?Åh
ÅhAlright, letÅfs do it.Åh
ÅhPlease wait, Rance-sama!
 We donÅft know that this robot will actually follow our
 orders!Åh
ÅhIf it doesnÅft listen and attacks us....
 What do we do, Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhWeÅfll destroy it.Åh
ÅhIÅfll destroy anyone who doesnÅft listen to my orders.
 ThatÅfs the natural, obvious way of things.Åh
ÅhYouÅfre right, Rance-san.
 You canÅft do anything if youÅfre scared of failing.Åh
ÅhCome on, letÅfs do it.
 The note said that we need to supply it with magic to
 move it, right? Go ahead, Sill-chan.Åh
ÅhI have to do it..?Åh
ÅhWell of course! If I did it, IÅfd get tired. And if I
 messed up and it attacked me, I could get hurt.Åh
Åh.......Åh
ÅhYeah, I wouldnÅft want Io getting attacked and hurt.
 Do it, Sill.Åh
ÅhOkay...Åh
Sill stood in front of the Tousho, put her hands
together, and closed her eyes.
ÅhRance-san, itÅfs dangerous, so letÅfs back up a little.Åh
ÅhSure.Åh
Åh..............Åh
Åh..............Åh
With a little shake, the Tousho started moving.
ÅhKya!Åh
Sill was sent flying and fell on her butt.
.... Åh........Åh
.... ÅhMy name is Borg Stomauss.
      Ending standby status and initiating activity.Åh
ÅhHold on, Tousho Borg.Åh
Borg ÅhA human, and not even a mage at that?
      Who are you?Åh
ÅhIÅfm Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhMy name is Sill.Åh
ÅhThe nameÅfs Io, Borg-chan.Åh
Borg ÅhVery well.
      What is the state of the war?Åh
ÅhWar? What are you talking about?Åh
Borg ÅhWhat happened with the Dark Lords who invaded the
      Defense Core?
      Did we repel them.. them.. them..?Åh
Borg ÅhGuh, my body is not yet fully repaired, but I must
      go, I must fight for humanity...Åh
ÅhWhat the heckÅfs this Tousho saying??Åh
ÅhHis memories are probably stuck at the point when he was
 deactivated.Åh
Borg Åh....What are you saying?Åh
ÅhI dunno where you wanna fight, but thereÅfs no war going
 on here now.Åh
Borg Åh....But then, how, how..
      How long was I suspended?Åh
ÅhWell, these ruins are a few hundred years old, so
 probably for a few hundred years.Åh
Borg Åh..........Åh
ÅhSo thatÅfs that. Your masterÅfs not around anymore.
 But IÅfll become your master from now on, so listen to
 what I say, okay?Åh
Borg ÅhNo matter how much time has passed, and whether or
      not my creator is no more, my mission remains
      unchanged.Åh
Borg ÅhTousho Borg Stomauss will continue to fight, even
      if he may be alone.Åh
ÅhHey, are you not listening to my orders after I went and
 activated you, you stupid mechanical doll?Åh
Borg ÅhMy mission is the eradication of the enemies of the
      Holy Magic SectÅF the Dark Lords, and the people of
      the surface.Åh
ÅhWhaaat!?Åh
Borg ÅhYou must be from the surface, since you canÅft use
      magic. You will die for your treachery.Åh
ÅhThis stupid mechanical doll.. IÅfm gonna destroy it!
 Sill, Io, letÅfs go!Åh
ÅhYes, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhYeah, how disappointing.
 It didnÅft go very well at all, did it?Åh
Borg ÅhHm..? You girls.
      You can use magic, canÅft you?
      Why do you side with this inferior man?Åh
ÅhRance-samaÅfs enemy is my enemy too!Åh
Borg ÅhSo there were traitors among the mages too...
      Very well.
      IÅfll eliminate the lot of you.Åh
ÅhYouÅfre the one whoÅfll be eliminated!
 IÅfm gonna make you scrap metal!Åh
Borg ÅhThis.. canÅft be.
      If only my repairs had been finished...Åh
ÅhThat was close, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhPhew... So theyÅfre this strong even when theyÅfre broken,
 huh...?Åh
ÅhHe was certainly very strong.
 If one unit has this much power, I canÅft even fathom how
 much power the entire Toushin Toshi would have had.Åh
Åh...........Åh
ThereÅfs a diary on the desk.
ÅhThis page looks important.Åh
I opened the diary to the page about Moganda.
ÅFXX Month X Day                          ÅF
ÅFI sent a Spy Dragonfly into Professor   ÅF
ÅFMogandaÅfs room. I found something       ÅF
ÅFterrible. He canÅft be forgiven for this.ÅF
ÅFProfessor Moganda has moved to a secret ÅF
ÅFunderground room behind his bookcase.   ÅF
ÅFHe must have built a secret reserch roomÅF
ÅFfor prohibited experiments.             ÅF
ÅFHe must be exiled.                      ÅF
ÅhLooks like this Moganda has a secret underground
 research room. If weÅfre gonna search somewhere, it
 should be there.Åh
ÅhYes, I bet the E Key is there.
 The E Key has to be in this East Block somewhere, so it
 must be there.Åh
ThereÅfs a diary on the desk.
ÅhLooks like the diary of a researcher here.
 Diaries must be read.Åh
I flipped through the diary.
ÅFX Month X Day                           ÅF
ÅFWe have begun testing of the new Tousho,ÅF
ÅFScarlet. So far, our expectations are   ÅF
ÅFbeing exceeded. Like I thought, speedingÅF
ÅFup brain access was a good idea.        ÅF
ÅFIt may also be because Scarlet was quiteÅF
ÅFa powerful warrior originally.          ÅF

ÅFGood food is good for your body and yourÅF

ÅFXX Month XX Day                         ÅF
ÅFProfessor Moganda is acting strange.    ÅF
ÅFI feel like heÅfs secretly doing         ÅF
ÅFforbidden research on non-human Tousho. ÅF
ÅFWeÅfll have to keep an eye on him.       ÅF
ÅFXX Month X Day                          ÅF
ÅFI sent a Spy Dragonfly into Professor   ÅF

ÅFIt didnÅft come back.                    ÅF
ÅFX Month X Day                           ÅF
ÅFToushin Toshi Upsilon will be activated ÅF
ÅFeven though itÅfs still incomplete.      ÅF
ÅFApparently the war is going badly enoughÅF
ÅFthat we need to use an unfinished       ÅF
ÅFToushin Toshi.                          ÅF
The diary was blank after that.
ÅhRance-sama, is ÅfProfessor MogandaÅf...?Åh
ÅhYeah, heÅfs probably that weirdo.Åh
ÅhAccording to this diary, thereÅfs a hidden passage that
 leads underground in Professor MogandaÅfs room, so I
 think we should look for it.Åh
ÅhAlright, letÅfs do it.Åh
ÅhThanks, we were really in trouble there. My name is
 Freak.
 Who might you be?Åh
ÅhI am Rance, the hero.Åh
ÅhA hero, eh...? YouÅfre a funny one.Åh
ÅhWhat was that, geezer!?Åh
ÅhNo, I wasnÅft making fun of you.
 If thatÅfs what it sounded like, IÅfll apologize.
 IÅfm sorry.Åh
ÅhThen, Hero Rance-dono, since youÅfve saved us, can I ask
 you for one more favor?Åh
ÅhGrandpa, these guys are from Leazas...Åh
ÅhLeave this to me, son of Toma.
 We are not strong enough for this.
 But you saw their strength, right?Åh
ÅhWhat are you muttering about?
 I donÅft listen to requests from men!Åh
ÅhWell, please just hear what I have to say.Åh
ÅhHero Rance-dono, you know of Upsilon, yes?Åh
ÅhYeah, I know.Åh
ÅhThe one we fought and lost to earlier, right?
 Rance-sama?Åh
ÅhWho lost, dumbass!?
 We just retreated for the time being!Åh
ÅhWe are also fighting Upsilon.
 If Upsilon runs wild, it could have very negative
 consequences for humanity. We must stop it.Åh
ÅhCould we join forces to defeat Upsilon for the sake of
 humanity?Åh
ÅhNo.Åh
ÅhEh? For the sake of humanity, and justice?Åh
ÅhI donÅft care about that shit.
 IÅfm gonna kill Upsilon Åfcause I donÅft like Åfim.
 You guys can fight for whatever you want on your own.Åh
ÅhThereÅfs no point in talking to these people, Grandpa.Åh
ÅhNo, Rance-dono.
 Instead of fighting separately, please, join...Åh
ÅhWell, if youÅfll work for me, I guess I could think about
 it.Åh
ÅhUnderstood.Åh
ÅhHey, Grandpa!
 Even if youÅfre joking, working for these Leazas...Åh
ÅhI am willing to go to any length to stop Upsilon.Åh
ÅhF-fine.
 IÅfll cooperate too.Åh
Freak and Hubert joined the party as my subordinates.
ÅhWell, they may be weak, but with these new members, why
 donÅft we go fight Upsilon again?Åh
ÅhHero Rance-dono, no matter how strong you may be, a fair
 fight with Upsilon is too risky.Åh
ÅhWhat are you being such a coward for?
 DonÅft you wanna beat Upsilon?Åh
ÅhOf course.
 But thereÅfs a way to defeat it without fighting it.Åh
ÅhUpsilonÅfs power is the power of this Toushin Toshi.
 If we destroy its power source, it will lose its
 strength.
 ThatÅfs where we should strike.Åh
ÅhIts power source.Åh
ÅhYes, the source of the energy powering the Toushin Toshi
 is currently a girl named Alicia.Åh
ÅhIf we take that girlÅfs life, the magic supply will
 stop.Åh
ÅhTake her life? You mean kill her?Åh
ÅhItÅfs for the sake of the world.Åh
ÅhNo way!
 I canÅft kill a girl for the sake of the world or for any
 other reason!Åh
Åh...........Åh
Åh......I understand.
 In that case, itÅfll be a little more work, but letÅfs
 destroy the Magic Columns storing the energy.Åh
ÅhThere are a total of eight columns, above and below
 ground, and if theyÅfre all destroyed, Upsilon should
 stop.Åh
ÅhAlright, weÅfll do that.
 LetÅfs get going.Åh
ÅhHm, whatÅfs this...??Åh
ÅhIt looks like a study room, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhNo, itÅfs some kind of research room.Åh
ÅhYeah, a research room.
 You lied, didnÅft you, Sill?Åh
ÅhEh? ThatÅfs not what I meant...Åh
ÅhYouÅfre terrible, Sill-chan.
 You tried to deceive Rance-san by lying, hm?
 IsnÅft she a bad girl, Rance-san?Åh
ÅhYup, she must be if you think so, Io.
 IÅfve gotta punish her I guess.Åh
ÅhIsnÅft that a bit much?Åh
ÅhWell, what kinda punishment should I give her?
 What do you think, Io?Åh
ÅhHmm, how about something like this?Åh
ÅhWe could doodle on her butt.
 DonÅft you think that would be fun?Åh
ÅhYeah, sure. LetÅfs do that.Åh
ÅhNo, please donÅft, Rance-sama!Åh
ÅhShut up. Hurry up and put your hands on the wall.Åh
Sill reluctantly stood facing the wall and put both of
her hands on it.
ÅhHey, stick your ass out some more and open your legs
 up.Åh
ÅhYes.. Rance-sama.Åh
Sill stuck her butt out, hands still on the wall.
ÅhKya, what a cute butt!Åh
Io gave SillÅfs butt a pat, giggling, and Sill cried out,
pulling her butt back in.
ÅhHey, donÅft change your pose.
 Stick your butt out again.Åh
Åh....Yes.Åh
I put my hand on SillÅfs panties and slid them down.
SillÅfs cute butt is exposed and defenseless.
ÅhWhat a cute butt.
 IÅfd like to go a round now, but your punishment is more
 important, so IÅfll try to bear it.Åh
Åh.........Åh
ÅhNow, IÅfll doodle with this magic marker!Åh
(Squeak squeak squeak)
I started doodling on SillÅfs butt with the marker.
ÅhOoh, IÅfm next, IÅfm next!Åh
(Squeak squeak squeak)
ÅhIdiot, dumbass, loser, youÅfre so stupid, Sill.Åh
Io and I doodled all over Sill.
ÅhKyahahaha, she looks sooo stupid!Åh
ÅhAlright, itÅfs complete.Åh
Åh*Sob* *sob*.Åh
ÅhIs this a research room too?Åh
ÅhLooks like it, Rance-sama.Åh
ÅhWhat the heck were they researching??
 I donÅft get it at all.Åh
ÅhIo, is the key in this research room somewhere?Åh
ÅhI donÅft know.
 LetÅfs look though.Åh
ÅhYeah.Åh
ItÅfs a statue of a Ham Bambara
ItÅfs a statue of an Asshole
ItÅfs a statue of a Pressure Master
ItÅfs a statue of an Octoman
ItÅfs a statue of a KyanKyan
ItÅfs a statue of a human
.
ÅhThey look like theyÅfre about to come to life any second
 now.Åh
ÅhYeah, IÅfd like one or two to decorate my house.Åh
