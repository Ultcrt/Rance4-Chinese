...A monster attacked.
Leave the room?
Descend stairs?
Descending to lower floor.
h—–z-sama, therefs a treasure chest.
 What should I do?h
hI feel like itfll explode if you open it.
 Leave it alone.h
hYes.h
hAlright, open it.h
hUnderstood.h
hHurry up and open it.
 Quickly now. Eliminate all unnecessary time spent and
 shorten the process.h
hItfs open, —–z-sama!h
hRance-sama, I foundF 
 inside.h
hIfll hold onto it.h
There should be a Tokko-chan hiding somewhere around
here.
hAre you here!!?h
I looked under the desk, but she wasnft there.
Itfs a normal desk.
There should be a Tokko-chan hiding somewhere around
here.
hAre you here!!?h
I opened the bookcase, but there was nothing but books
inside.
Itfs a bookcase.
There are books like hAutomobiles for Kids,h hFighter
Jets for Kids,h and hFrench for Kidsh inside.
There should be a Tokko-chan hiding somewhere around
here.
hTherefs no point in hiding!h
(Clack)
I opened the closet.
Tokko-chan hKyaaaa!h
hI found you!h
Tokko hNo, stop, stop it!
       Donft kill me!!h
hIfm not gonna kill you!
 I just wanna play!h
I embraced the Tokko-chan and stuck my raging hyper
weapon right into her.
Tokko hIt hurts.. Mommy, help me!!h
hGahahahahaha...!
 It only hurts in the beginning!h
But therefs blood coming out of the Tokko-chanfs pussy
where my huge thing is in her, so I bet it hurts a lot...
It feels great for me though, so I donft really care.
(Ram ram ram)
Tokko hAaaah, aaah!h
(Ram ram ram ram spurt!)
...........
.............
Itfs a normal closet.
There should be a Tokko-chan hiding somewhere around
here.
hAre you here!!?h
I looked under the table, but she wasnft there.
Itfs a normal table.
There should be a Tokko-chan hiding somewhere around
here.
hI know youfre hiding in here!
 Come on out!h
I looked under the bed, but the Tokko-chan wasnft hiding
there.
Itfs a cute bed.
Itfs a cupboard with a bunch of medicine and bandages and
stuff in it.
Therefs nothing particularly strange about it.
Itfs a shelf with a bunch of medicine on it.
There are a bunch of mysterious drugs.
There are two large beakers, one with [‰Á”M“IàŞ—]
written on it, the other with [Monkeytic].
hOh, this is ‰Á”M“IàŞ—, one of the things I need for
 my Tulip #1fs power up.h
hHow nice! Ifll just take this.h
Obtained ‰Á”M“IàŞ—.
Itfs a bookcase packed with books.
hKuh, they all look like complicated books that arenft
 fun at all.h
Just a normal table.
Therefs nothing particularly strange about it.
hRance-sama, therefs some kind of note here.h
hUmm... It says...
 Misly.. so.. Caren??
 ......
 Re-plica....h
hI canft really read this ancient script...h
hHm? Lemme see.h
hOh, itfs a cute girl!
 Was she auditioning for something?h
Therefs a bottle of something or other in this cupboard.
hŠó˜I, find anything valuable?h
hHmm.. not really.
 It looks like a bunch of experimental drugs and bandages
 and things like that.h
Just a normal desk.
Hmmm, not something thatfd come in handy for me right
now.
Therefs a large stone table.
hThis is an operating table, Rance-sama.
 Itfs something doctors use.h
hSo itfs a table doctors and nurses use to have fun on,
 huh..?h
hI think itfs actually for operations....h
Itfs a shabby bed.
hMan, I get really excited when I see beds.
 I wonder why.h
hYeah, like right around my hips here.
 Right, Šó˜I?h
hI.. I donft know.h
Itfs a model of the human body. How creepy.
hItfs kind of creepy, isnft it, Rance-sama?h
hCreepy? Youfd look just like this with your skin peeled
 off, you know.h
h.....h
hWhatfs this hole??h
There was a hole that looked like it was probably there
for a reason in the middle of the room, but when I looked
down it, I couldnft see anything. Itfs pretty deep.
hWait, therefs something there!h
hYou see something, ‰Á“Ş”ü?
 Itfs pitch black.h
hDonft underestimate a ninjafs eyes. I train every day to
 be able to see long-distance, you know.h
hWow, thatfs amazing, ‰Á“Ş”ü-san.h
hSo what do you see?h
hTherefs something like a gem stuck in the wall part of
 the way down this hole.h
hWhat? Something valuable?h
hLooks like.
 I think I can reach it.h
‰Á“Ş”ü hooked her legs around the railing and reached
down into the hole.
hUgh... cfmon, cfmon, just a bit more...h
I gingerly touched ‰Á“Ş”üfs defenseless butt.
h.....Kya!h
hHowfs it going, ‰Á“Ş”ü? Did you get it?h
hGeez, donft touch my butt!
 I couldfve fallen!h
hGahahahahaha, itfs a nice, pretty butt.h
hGeez. Here.
 I got it.h
‰Á“Ş”ü handed a diamond to me.
Obtained Diamond.
An expensive-looking magefs staff, the ‰Î”V–@ñ, is
stuck in the ground.
hOhh, itfs just sitting there like fplease take me,f
 isnft it?h
hBut this must be a trap, Rance-sama.h
hAlright, Ifm gonna take it.h
I grabbed the ‰Î”V–@ñ and pulled.
(Zap) Something like electricity passed from the grip
through my hand and into my body.
Rancefs experience became 0.
h....Fucking hell!!
 What a clever trap!h
I got caught in the clever trap and lost experience.
hŠó˜I, itfs a weapon for a mage.
 You pull it out.h
hOkay.h
Šó˜I grabbed the ‰Î”V–@ñfs handle and..
hKya!h
Šó˜I fell onto her butt.
A mysterious light passed from the staff through her hand
and around her body.
Šó˜Ifs experience became 0.
h*Sob* *sob*, Rance-sama!
 I lost all my experience!h
hRance-sama, we have to undo the sealing magic on this
 staff to take it.h
hGrab that staff, ˆÉ‰œ.h
hNo way, itfs probably trapped.
 Make Šó˜I-chan take it.h
h....I guess youfre right.h
Use which item?
hAlright, itfs probably fine to touch it with these
 Rubber Gloves.h
h...........h
hYoufd better not be doubting me, Šó˜I.
 My plans are perfect.h
hOf course not.
 I think itfs a good idea.h
hRight? This ‰Î”V–@ñ has some kind of weird power in
 its handle, but if you protect yourself with these
 Rubber Gloves, youfll be fine!
 Gahahahahahahaha!h
hSo, Šó˜I.
 Use the Rubber Gloves and take it.h
hYes, Rance-sama.h
Šó˜I put the Rubber Gloves on and grabbed the ‰Î”V–@ñ
timidly.
h.........h
hHuh? Nothingfs happening.
 Rance-sama, the Rubber Gloves really undid the seal on
 the staff.h
hGahahahahahahaha, of course! It was my idea after all!h
hWow, Rance-sama, youfre amazing!h
The Rubber Gloves disintigrated and became useless, but I
managed to obtain the ‰Î”V–@ñ safely.
hRance-sama, how are you going to use that
?h
h......Never mind.h
hRance-sama, do you think therefs a hidden passageway
 behind this bookcase?h
hAlright, Šó˜I.
 Try and move it.h
hOkay, Ifll try.h
hHeave-ho, heave-ho.h
Itfs a small device with four buttons on it.
hWell, it looks safe enough, so letfs try pushing
 something.h
There are four buttons, so which should I push?
I pushed the purple button.
  (Push)
I pushed the blue button.
  (Push)
I pushed the black button.
  (Push)
I pushed the red button.
  (Push)
h........h
hWhatfs wrong, Rance-sama?
 Youfre not going to push one?h
hNah.h
hWhat the heckfs this machine?
 There are four buttons. Well, might as well push one,
 right?h
hNo, Rance-san!h
hHm...?h
(Push) ƒ|Pushed a button.
hThatfs a device to destroy the world!
 If you push that, the world will be enveloped in dark
 flames and everything will return to nothing!h
hAck, are you serious..? Eeee!!
 I already pushed it!!!h
hKyaaa, Rance-sama..! Geez..!h
hMy worldfs gonna be destroyed.. If I had known this was
 gonna happen, Ifd have slept with more womeeeeen..!h
hI lied.h
hEh??h
hI lied. You actually thought that was the truth?h
h.........h
hRance-sama, therefs some kind of note.h
I picked up the note on top of the desk.
hLetfs see here.....h
FReactivating an Under Repair Tousho          F
F To reactivate a Tousho that is under repair,F
F provide its brain with magic energy.        F
F Over 20 magic is required.                  F
FTousho Energy                                F
F Tousho can function almost indefinitely     F
F without food. However, most requre periodic F
F magic injection from a technician.          F
FOrdering a Tousho                            F
F The Toushin has absolute authority to give  F
F Tousho orders, but they normally cannot     F
F disobey orders from us mages either.        F
...
hItfs just boring shit.h
hItfs probably a note written by someone rerõing or
 studying these fToushof.h
Therefs a small hole in the wall.
hAlright, Ifm gonna spy on Ran-chan again.
 Fufufu, she might be changing or something right now!h
I peered into the small hole.
(Staaaaaaaaaaaaare)
hRance-sama.. can you see anything?h
h...........h
h......Itfs pitch black.h
Clicking my tongue in annoyance, I gave up on looking
through the hole.
hShit, I couldnft see anything.
 Šó˜I, make it so that I can see naked Ran.h
hI canft, Rance-sama.h
hShut up, do it, do it, do it, do it!!h
hRance-samaaa.. I caaanft..!h
hWell fine, then YOU get naked.h
hBut Rance-sama, why?h
hShut it.h
hRance-sama, therefs a hole in the wall.h
hHow suspicious.. It might be a trap.h
hThis is a dangerous one. It could shoot an arrow or spew
 poisonous gas if you look into it.h
hThatfs scary, Rance-sama.h
hYeah, but.. I could see something nice.
 Therefs a saying that goes fnothing ventured, nothing
 gainedf.h
hDfyou know what it means, Sill?h
hYes, it means that you wonft obtain anything if you
 donft act knowing it could be dangerous.h
hRight.h
hTherefs the danger of overlooking some kind of amazing
 discovery if we donft look into this hole.h
hI.. I suppose...h
hAlright, Sill.
 Do it.h
hBut.. Rance-sama, Ifm scared!h
hDo it.h
hRance-samaaa..!h
Sill looks at me as if pleading.
hSill, do it.h
h...Okay.h
Trembling.. Sill looked into the hole.
h.........h
hWhat is it? Dfyou see something?h
h....Huh??h
hWhat is it??
 What do you see??h
h....Well.. Ran-san...h
hWhat!? Ran!!?
 Get outta my way!h
I shoved Sill aside and swiftly looked into the hole.
hLetfs see...h
Oh... Itfs Ran...!
...........
Ran hPhew... Ifm tired.h
Ran hKathtomfs budget deficit is at its limit, huh..
     Oh.. This is terrible.h
Looks like Ranfs doing some accounting in Kathtom.
Ran h...Wefd be bankrupt if not for àó—˜ˆŸ and u—¥
     earning some money in Leazas.h
Ran hHm...? Is, is someone there...?h
Ran glanced around as if shefd become aware of my gaze.
Ran hNo onefs there... right?
     It must just be my imagination.h
hI can see Ran. Whatfs going on?h
hYes, I donft really understand, but here and there must
 be connected somehow....h
hHmmm, if it were gonna connect somewhere, it coulda
 connected to like a bath or something. Too bad.h
Therefs a mysterious blue sphere floating.
hWhat the heckfs this sphere?h
hKyan, a ghost..!!h
h........h
hBoo..!h
hNooo, Ifm scared, Ifm scaaared!h
h..........h
hBoo...!h
h..........h
hB...h
h...Fufufufufu, youfre pretty cute.h
h.....h
hLet me do youuuuu!!h
I tried to pounce on the ghost but I just went straight
through her.
hUwah.. whoops.. what the?h
h...Umm, are you okay?h
hTch, shefs got no body fcause shefs a ghost..
 so we canft do it?h
hRance-sama, youfll be possessed if you do something like
 that.h
hUmm....h
hHow could I have sex if I worried about every little
 thing like that!?
 Where therefs a will, therefs a way!h
hUmm....h
hRance-san, the ghostfs trying to talk to us.
 Why donft we hear what she has to say?h
hI guess so.
 What do you want to say, Ghost I Canft Fuck?h
hAre you... not a mage?h
hOf course not.
 ˆÉ‰œ here and my slave Sill are mages though.h
hIfm a famous warrior.h
hOh good, so youfre not someone from the Sect?h
hSect? I dunno what that is, so no.h
hPlease help me pass on.h
hHahahahaha, I thought this would happen.h
hYou did? What do you mean, Rance-san?h
hIf a ghost appears, youfre always gonna end up helping
 it pass on, right?h
hThis stufffs painfully easy to predict when youfve been
 adventuring as long as I have.h
h....Ifm sorry.h
hWhatever.
 Why donft you tell me about yourself?h
hSo youfll help me pass on?
 Thank you so much.h
hNah, itfs not like Ifve decided.
 Ifll decide after you talk.h
h...Okay.h
hMy name is Naturi Dora.
 I used to live in Rukra Village.h
hNaturi-chan, eh? So what happened to you?h
h........h
hWhat is it? Hurry up and tell me.h
hWell, it happened hundreds of years ago, so I forgot.h
hYou forgot!!?
 Well what are we supposed to do then?h
hRance-san, letfs leave this ghost alone and go find my
 keys.h
hYeah, we probably should.h
hP.. please wait.h
hPlease help me pass on.
 Ifll give you a key as thanks.h
hWhat? A key?
 Is it one wefre looking for?h
hI donft know, but it could be.h
hFine, if youfll give us a key, Ifll think about it.
 But first, show me this key.h
hNo.h
hWhaaat!?
 Just show it to me a little bit!h
hIf I showed it to you, youfd just take it and run,
 right?
 I get the feeling thatfs what would happen.h
hShe saw through you, Rance-sama.h
hShut it.h
(Hit hit hit hit)
h*Sob* *sob*.h
hI got it. Ifll try to find a way to make you pass on.h
hThank you. Ifm so happy.h
hSo is there anything at all you remember?h
hWell, it was hundreds of years ago...
 Although.. I remember being experimented on while I was
 alive.h
hSad, painful memories..h
hI just want to pass on soon.h
hYeah. Leave it to me.h
hHey, Naturi-san.
 You were experimented on, right?h
hYes...h
hHmmm? So then did they do a bunch of dirty stuff to
 you?h
h.....h
hLike saying it was for an experiment and giving you
 electric shocks in you-know-where.....h
hWhoa, thatfs super lewd!h
hOr like calling it freproductive rerõf and making
 you have sex with monsters..?h
hWhoa.. Thatfs so lewd!h
h...No, nothing like that.
 No, no...h
hI donft think so....h
hOh? You donft remember, so you canft deny it completely,
 can you?
 *Giggle* *giggle*.h
hAahn, I just want to pass on soon!h
hAahn, I just want to pass on soon!h
hI just found something interesting in a cell back
 there.h
hSomething interesting??
 What was it? What was it?h
hIt was your corpse.h
h......h
hYour corpse, chained cruelly and left to rot. Nothing
 but bones now.h
hWaah, waah, my body..!
 Waah waah, waah, waah!h
hShut up, stop crying!h
hWaah, waah, waah, waah, waah,
 waah, waah, waah, waah!h
hI mean, I found your body, so..
 you should be able to pass on now..h
hWaah, waah, waah, waah, waah,
 waah, waah, waah, waah!h
hSo...h
hWaah, waah, waah, waah, waah,
 waah, waah, waah, waah!h
hRance-sama, shefs crying too much to hear anything
 youfre saying.h
h...Shefs like the fuckinf Dog Policeman.h
hPlease help me....h
hYeah, yeah. If I used this holy water, it should be
 easy.
 Just wait a little longer.h
hThank you.h
hWhen you pass on, you better gimme that key.
 Donft forget, okay?h
hOf course. I wonft need it on the other side.
 Ifll give it to you when Ifve passed on.h
Itfs a weathered skeleton.
h...Just bones, huh? How pitiful.h
hPlease rest in peace.h
hSill, stop praying and check these bones out.h
hEhhh?h
hDonft complain, just figure out if therefs anything
 valuable on fem.h
hI donft want to.. fcause..
 Ifm scared.h
hStop complaining and just do it!h
Sill accepted her fate and investigated the skeleton.
hI didnft find anything, Rance-sama.h
hSill, check for valuables.h
h...Yes.h
Sill started timidly examining the skeleton.
hWell? Found anything?h
hRance-sama, this skeleton... itfs a woman.
 Itfs wearing womenfs clothes.h
hA woman, eh? Canft tell if she was cute or ugly. I guess
 itfs all the same once youfre like this.h
hOh.....h
hWhat? fD you find something?h
hRance-sama, do you think this skeleton is Naturi-san,
 the ghost from earlier?h
hWhat?h
hShefs wearing the same clothes.h
hHuh. I guess.. she is.h
hHow terrible. She died in chains like this. She must
 have been too sad to pass on.h
hI guess so.h
The ghost girlfs skeleton is tied in chains.
hI feel sorry for her.h
hThe question is how do we get her to pass on?
 Hmmm.h
hRance-sama, why donft we go ask at the church?h
hThe church??
 Cynthiafs church????h
hYes.
 Itfs the only church in this town.
 The god is a little weird, but...
 Okay, maybe youfre right.h
hHmmm, this is a difficult problem.h
hOkay, this is the body, right?h
hLetfs use the Holy Water, Rance-sama.h
hAlright.h
I took out the bottle of Holy Water, twisted off the cap,
and sprinkled the Holy Water on the skeleton.
(...........)
hAhh, my body is so light.
 I donft feel bound anymore.h
hThank you so much.h
hYup, you better thank me 200,000 times.h
hThank you. 1.h
hThank you. 2.h
hThank you. 3.h
hThank you. 4.h
hThank you. 5.h
hThank you. 6.h
hThank you. 7.h
hThank you. 8.h
hThank you. 9.h
hYoufre annoying me. Thatfs enough.
 Do the last 199,991 in your head.h
hOkay.h
hThatfs great. You can pass on without any regrets now,
 right?h
h..........h
hHm? What is it?h
h..........h
hYou better not say youfve still got regrets or
 something.h
hRance-sama, Naturi-san was subject to terrible
 experiments, remember? She could still hold a grudge or
 something about that...h
hA grudge.. Is that it, Naturi?h
hThatfs not it.
 Itfs not that at all.h
hThen what is it?
 Make up your mind already.h
hIfm ready to move on, but I do have one regret...h
hIf itfs not a grudge, then what is it?h
hTherefs one thing I want to experience.
 I.. I want to have sex.h
hSex??h
hI see, so that was it, well thatfs easy!
 Ifll fuck you!h
I tried to embrace Naturi, but I just went through her.
hWaah, I hate having no body!h
hHmmm, no matter how great at sex I am, I canft really do
 anything if we canft touch.h
hWaah, waah!h
hIfve got a good idea, Rance-san.h
hAn idea??h
hYes, wefll give Naturi-san a body.h
hBut how?h
hJust possess that girl and have sex.h
ˆÉ‰œ pointed at Sill.
hHeh? M.. me??h
hYeah, itfs to help her pass on.
 You can put up with this for her, canft you?h
hBut.. I...h
hPlease?h
hAlright, Sill.
 Lend her your body.h
h.............h
hI told you to lend it to her!
 Are you not listening to my orders!?h
hI.. I understand.h
hThank you very much.h
Naturi turned into something like white mist and entered
Sillfs body.
Hmm, this is kinda creepy.
h..This is me?
 It feels kind of strange having a body after all this
 time.h
hWell, we donft have much time, so letfs get to it.h
hItfs.. my first time, so please be gentle...h
hDonft even worry about it. Your bodyfs not a virgin, so
 it wonft hurt at all.
 Ifve even been cultivating it, so itfs probably pretty
 sensitive.
 Youfre pretty lucky that this is how your first timefs
 gonna be.h
hThen Ifll leave it to you.h
hLetfs go, Sill.. I mean, Naturi.
 Ifll teach you what men are like!h
I embraced the embarrassed Sill (Naturi) and swiftly
stripped her.
hAhn, no, Ifm scared!h
Ifm used to fucking Sillfs body, but since itfs someone
else inside it, this is kind of strange.
This might be kind of hard.
hDonft struggle, come on.h
I held down her body as she tried to get away and
attacked all of Sillfs weak spots.
After a few of my attacks, Naturi seemed to change and,
finally, surrender.
hAh.. ah.. ah.. *gasp*..
 My body feels.. strange.. weird..!h
hI know 100% of the time where to touch to get Sill to
 respond.
 Come on, this is next.h
I stuck my finger into her ass and moved it around a
little, making Sillfs body jump.
hKyan!h
hNow, we donft have much time, so letfs get to it.h
hOh, okay.h
I grabbed Sillfs hips and placed my raging destructive
weapon to her wet pussy.
hW-wait a second!h
hNope, not gonna.h
(Ram)
My meat sword went right into its personal scabbard.
hAAAAAAaaaah!!h
hHowfs that? Feels good, right?
 Ifll make you feel even better next!h
I embraced Sillfs body and shook my hips, beginning my
Mad Piston Attack.
..............
...............
hThanks so much for the good time.
 Now I can rest in peace.h
hYep, no problem.h
hHere, this is the key I promised you.h
I received the Œ¤‹†ºèoú.
hThis is the wrong key!
 We donft need this one!h
hWhat!?h
hWell, goodbye.h
hHey, wait, this is the wrong key!
 Gimme a different..!h
...........
hTch, shefs gone.h
hSo this is really the wrong key, ˆÉ‰œ?h
hYeah, I need the W Key, the “Œ•”èoú, the N Key, and the S
 Key.h
hShit!h
hBut Rance-sama, with this Œ¤‹†ºèoú, we can explore a
 new place, so I think wefll be able to find them now.h
h.........h
hLetfs do our best, Rance-sama.h
h.............h
hRance-sama, therefs a weird ball on the desk.h
I casually picked up the ball.
It was a perfectly circular ball, 10 cm in diameter.
I dunno what the hell itfs made of.
hWhat do you think this ball is, ˆÉ‰œ?h
hThatfs Uppii shit.
 It looks pink and pretty, but....h
hACK, shit!!?
 Gross!h
I tossed the ball to Sill.
hNo, eww!h
hI lied.h
hHeh??h
hWell of course it was a lie.
 The truth is I donft know what it is either.h
hRance-sama!h
hShut up! What do you want?h
hIf you look really close, you can see letters on this
 pink ball.h
hWhat?h
I took the ball from Sill and spun it around, looking for
the letters, and sure enough, there they were.
hLetfs see. It says fThis is an ‰ğ“Å‹Ê. Any idiot
 can use it to instantly cure poisonf.h
hHmm, an ‰ğ“Å‹Ê, eh?
 Think we can use it over where that poisonous mist is?h
hProbably. Anyway, letfs take it.h
Obtained ‰ğ“Å‹Ê.
hWhat the heckfs this??h
hItfs a robot, Rance-sama! A robot!h
hRobot??h
hYes, Ifve heard about them from àó—˜ˆŸ-san.
 Theyfre unliving things made with iron mechanisms.h
hI donft get it at all.h
hRance-sama, this....h
hYeah, this must be one of those Tou-slow guys from that
 note.h
hYou mean Tousho, Rance-sama.h
h....Right, Tousho.h
hWanna try moving it, Rance-san?h
hMoving it??h
hYeah, Tousho are fighting weapons thatfll listen to any
 order. It could be a good subordinate for us.h
hI see. It looks pretty strong, so itfs probably way more
 useful than Sill.h
hYeah, yeah.
 That note said that they couldnft disobey orders,
 right?h
hAlright, letfs do it.h
hPlease wait, Rance-sama!
 We donft know that this robot will actually follow our
 orders!h
hIf it doesnft listen and attacks us....
 What do we do, Rance-sama?h
hWefll destroy it.h
hIfll destroy anyone who doesnft listen to my orders.
 Thatfs the natural, obvious way of things.h
hYoufre right, Rance-san.
 You canft do anything if youfre scared of failing.h
hCome on, letfs do it.
 The note said that we need to supply it with magic to
 move it, right? Go ahead, Sill-chan.h
hI have to do it..?h
hWell of course! If I did it, Ifd get tired. And if I
 messed up and it attacked me, I could get hurt.h
h.......h
hYeah, I wouldnft want ˆÉ‰œ getting attacked and hurt.
 Do it, Sill.h
hOkay...h
Sill stood in front of the Tousho, put her hands
together, and closed her eyes.
hRance-san, itfs dangerous, so letfs back up a little.h
hSure.h
h..............h
h..............h
With a little shake, the Tousho started moving.
hKya!h
Sill was sent flying and fell on her butt.
.... h........h
.... hMy name is Borg Stomauss.
      Ending standby status and initiating activity.h
hHold on, Tousho Borg.h
Borg hA human, and not even a mage at that?
      Who are you?h
hIfm Rance-sama.h
hMy name is Sill.h
hThe namefs ˆÉ‰œ, Borg-chan.h
Borg hVery well.
      What is the state of the war?h
hWar? What are you talking about?h
Borg hWhat happened with the Dark Lords who invaded the
      Defense Core?
      Did we repel them.. them.. them..?h
Borg hGuh, my body is not yet fully repaired, but I must
      go, I must fight for humanity...h
hWhat the heckfs this Tousho saying??h
hHis memories are probably stuck at the point when he was
 deactivated.h
Borg h....What are you saying?h
hI dunno where you wanna fight, but therefs no war going
 on here now.h
Borg h....But then, how, how..
      How long was I suspended?h
hWell, these ruins are a few hundred years old, so
 probably for a few hundred years.h
Borg h..........h
hSo thatfs that. Your masterfs not around anymore.
 But Ifll become your master from now on, so listen to
 what I say, okay?h
Borg hNo matter how much time has passed, and whether or
      not my creator is no more, my mission remains
      unchanged.h
Borg hTousho Borg Stomauss will continue to fight, even
      if he may be alone.h
hHey, are you not listening to my orders after I went and
 activated you, you stupid mechanical doll?h
Borg hMy mission is the eradication of the enemies of the
      Holy Magic SectF the Dark Lords, and the people of
      the surface.h
hWhaaat!?h
Borg hYou must be from the surface, since you canft use
      magic. You will die for your treachery.h
hThis stupid mechanical doll.. Ifm gonna destroy it!
 Sill, ˆÉ‰œ, letfs go!h
hYes, Rance-sama.h
hYeah, how disappointing.
 It didnft go very well at all, did it?h
Borg hHm..? You girls.
      You can use magic, canft you?
      Why do you side with this inferior man?h
hRance-samafs enemy is my enemy too!h
Borg hSo there were traitors among the mages too...
      Very well.
      Ifll eliminate the lot of you.h
hYoufre the one whofll be eliminated!
 Ifm gonna make you scrap metal!h
Borg hThis.. canft be.
      If only my repairs had been finished...h
hThat was close, Rance-sama.h
hPhew... So theyfre this strong even when theyfre broken,
 huh...?h
hHe was certainly very strong.
 If one unit has this much power, I canft even fathom how
 much power the entire Toushin Toshi would have had.h
h...........h
Therefs a diary on the desk.
hThis page looks important.h
I opened the diary to the page about ”œŠ±’B.

hLooks like this ”œŠ±’B has a secret underground
 research room. If wefre gonna search somewhere, it
 should be there.h
hYes, I bet the “Œ•”èoú is there.
 The “Œ•”èoú has to be in this East Block somewhere, so it
 must be there.h
Therefs a diary on the desk.
hLooks like the diary of a researcher here.
 Diaries must be read.h
I flipped through the diary.

The diary was blank after that.
hRance-sama, is fProfessor ”œŠ±’Bf...?h
hYeah, hefs probably that weirdo.h
hAccording to this diary, therefs a hidden passage that
 leads underground in Professor ”œŠ±’Bfs room, so I
 think we should look for it.h
hAlright, letfs do it.h
hThanks, we were really in trouble there. My name is
 •¤—¢.
 Who might you be?h
hI am Rance, the hero.h
hA hero, eh...? Youfre a funny one.h
hWhat was that, geezer!?h
hNo, I wasnft making fun of you.
 If thatfs what it sounded like, Ifll apologize.
 Ifm sorry.h
hThen, Hero Rance-dono, since youfve saved us, can I ask
 you for one more favor?h
hGrandpa, these guys are from Leazas...h
hLeave this to me, son of Toma.
 We are not strong enough for this.
 But you saw their strength, right?h
hWhat are you muttering about?
 I donft listen to requests from men!h
hWell, please just hear what I have to say.h
hHero Rance-dono, you know of Upsilon, yes?h
hYeah, I know.h
hThe one we fought and lost to earlier, right?
 Rance-sama?h
hWho lost, dumbass!?
 We just retreated for the time being!h
hWe are also fighting Upsilon.
 If Upsilon runs wild, it could have very negative
 consequences for humanity. We must stop it.h
hCould we join forces to defeat Upsilon for the sake of
 humanity?h
hNo.h
hEh? For the sake of humanity, and justice?h
hI donft care about that shit.
 Ifm gonna kill Upsilon fcause I donft like fim.
 You guys can fight for whatever you want on your own.h
hTherefs no point in talking to these people, Grandpa.h
hNo, Rance-dono.
 Instead of fighting separately, please, join...h
hWell, if youfll work for me, I guess I could think about
 it.h
hUnderstood.h
hHey, Grandpa!
 Even if youfre joking, working for these Leazas...h
hI am willing to go to any length to stop Upsilon.h
hF-fine.
 Ifll cooperate too.h
•¤—¢ and ‹x”Œ“Á joined the party as my subordinates.
hWell, they may be weak, but with these new members, why
 donft we go fight Upsilon again?h
hHero Rance-dono, no matter how strong you may be, a fair
 fight with Upsilon is too risky.h
hWhat are you being such a coward for?
 Donft you wanna beat Upsilon?h
hOf course.
 But therefs a way to defeat it without fighting it.h
hUpsilonfs power is the power of this Toushin Toshi.
 If we destroy its power source, it will lose its
 strength.
 Thatfs where we should strike.h
hIts power source.h
hYes, the source of the energy powering the Toushin Toshi
 is currently a girl named Alicia.h
hIf we take that girlfs life, the magic supply will
 stop.h
hTake her life? You mean kill her?h
hItfs for the sake of the world.h
hNo way!
 I canft kill a girl for the sake of the world or for any
 other reason!h
h...........h
h......I understand.
 In that case, itfll be a little more work, but letfs
 destroy the Magic Columns storing the energy.h
hThere are a total of eight columns, above and below
 ground, and if theyfre all destroyed, Upsilon should
 stop.h
hAlright, wefll do that.
 Letfs get going.h
hHm, whatfs this...??h
hIt looks like a study room, Rance-sama.h
hNo, itfs some kind of research room.h
hYeah, a research room.
 You lied, didnft you, Sill?h
hEh? Thatfs not what I meant...h
hYoufre terrible, Sill-chan.
 You tried to deceive Rance-san by lying, hm?
 Isnft she a bad girl, Rance-san?h
hYup, she must be if you think so, ˆÉ‰œ.
 Ifve gotta punish her I guess.h
hIsnft that a bit much?h
hWell, what kinda punishment should I give her?
 What do you think, ˆÉ‰œ?h
hHmm, how about something like this?h
hWe could doodle on her butt.
 Donft you think that would be fun?h
hYeah, sure. Letfs do that.h
hNo, please donft, Rance-sama!h
hShut up. Hurry up and put your hands on the wall.h
Sill reluctantly stood facing the wall and put both of
her hands on it.
hHey, stick your ass out some more and open your legs
 up.h
hYes.. Rance-sama.h
Sill stuck her butt out, hands still on the wall.
hKya, what a cute butt!h
Io gave Sillfs butt a pat, giggling, and Sill cried out,
pulling her butt back in.
hHey, donft change your pose.
 Stick your butt out again.h
h....Yes.h
I put my hand on Sillfs panties and slid them down.
Sillfs cute butt is exposed and defenseless.
hWhat a cute butt.
 Ifd like to go a round now, but your punishment is more
 important, so Ifll try to bear it.h
h.........h
hNow, Ifll doodle with this magic marker!h
(Squeak squeak squeak)
I started doodling on Sillfs butt with the marker.
hOoh, Ifm next, Ifm next!h
(Squeak squeak squeak)
hIdiot, dumbass, loser, youfre so stupid, Sill.h
Io and I doodled all over Sill.
hKyahahaha, she looks sooo stupid!h
hAlright, itfs complete.h
h*Sob* *sob*.h
hIs this a research room too?h
hLooks like it, Rance-sama.h
hWhat the heck were they researching??
 I donft get it at all.h
hIo, is the key in this research room somewhere?h
hI donft know.
 Letfs look though.h
hYeah.h
Itfs a statue of a Ham Bambara
Itfs a statue of an Asshole
Itfs a statue of a Pressure Master
Itfs a statue of an Octoman
Itfs a statue of a KyanKyan
Itfs a statue of a human
.
hThey look like theyfre about to come to life any second
 now.h
hYeah, Ifd like one or two to decorate my house.h
