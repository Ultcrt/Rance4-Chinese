...A monster attacked.
Leave the room?
hWork hard today too.h
hWe are Magic Farmers.
 We live to work.h
A weird-looking (not human, right?) person was holding a
hoe and doing farmwork.
What the heck is this thing?
Well, letfs try talking to it.
hHello.h
hHello.
 Work.h
hUmm.. what are you doing?h
hPlowing field.
 Heave ho.h
hThis thingfs a Magic Farmer.
 Ifve never seen one before.h
hMagic Farmer?
 You know what it is, u—¥?h
hYeah, I read about them in a grimoire a long time ago.h
hTheyfre scarecrows powered by magic who do farmwork
 forever.h
hThey canft produce anything that requires complex
 knowledge or experience, but they can produce simple
 things.h
hThatfs amazing.
 If you had a bunch of them, couldnft you eliminate
 hunger and poverty?h
hBut Julia has a question. Wouldnft farmers all lose
 their jobs then? —¢-chanfs papafs a farmer, right?
 So hefd be in trouble!h
hYou donft need to worry about that. Itfs difficult to
 make these Magic Farmers. Itfs impossible for anyone
 without considerable magic power.h
hCould you make one, u—¥-chan?h
hI think I could, but I donft know the spell.
 I only study combat ones, so.h
hHmmm. But that means theyfre not alive, right?
 Theyfre just scarecrows growing food for humans?h
hYeah.h
hThen that must mean therefs someone on this continent
 somewhere making them work....h
hI see. That sounds reasonable.h
hIt couldnft be Rance, could it?h
hThatfs impossible.
 Therefs no way he could ever do anything productive.h
hAll he can do is destroy and loot everything in his
 path.
 If it were him, hefd be doing slash-and-burn farming.h
hThen who are they producing these crops for?h
hWork, work.h
hHey, Mr. Magic Farmer?
 Whofs your master?h
hWork, work.
 Order is farmwork.h
hDoesnft look like therefs any point in asking.h
hLooks like the path appears when someone steps on this.h
hSo if somebody stands on this, the rest of us can get
 across.h
hWefll have to have someone stay behind then.
 Who should..h
hWell then, I...h
hJuliafll stay!h
hWill you be okay, Julia?h
hIfll be fine!
 Ifm tired of walking, so Ifll wait over here.h
hOkay. Then wefll leave it to you, Julia-chan.h
hYeah!h
hDonft move from there, okay?
 Do you get it, Julia?h
hYeah, Julia wonft move!h
hRance-sama, itfs a treasure chest.
 What should I do?h
hI feel like itfll explode if you open it.
 Leave it alone.h
hYes.h
hAlright, open it.h
hUnderstood.h
hHurry up and open it.
 Quickly now. Eliminate all unnecessary time spent and
 shorten the process.h
hItfs open, Rance-sama!h
hRance-sama, I foundF 
 inside.h
hIfll hold onto it.h
hOh, Šóff‡‹à!h
hŠóff‡‹à? What the heckfs that??
 Is it food??h
hNo, itfs not food.
 This is a special metal filled with energy.h
hThis Tulip #1 and its ammunition are made with it.h
hHmmmm?h
hIfd like to take some, but Ifll hold back for now.
 Ifll come back later when I need some.h
hHow long are you gonna be looking at those pebbles,
 Maria?h
hSorry. Letfs go.h
Therefs a mountain of little yellow rocks.
It sure doesnft look very valuable.
hYeah, that Šóff‡‹à.h
hHirara??? Harara??h
hIf I have this, I can power up the Tulip #1.
 Letfs take some.h
Maria started happily gathering up the worthless-looking
rocks.
Obtained Šóff‡‹à.
hTherefs something written on this sign.h
hRance-sama, therefs something written on this sign.
 Umm...h
F Planet Kurupiston Destruction Button     F
FThis button is a firing device to launch  F
Fnuclear missiles at the Planet Kurupiston,F
Fmany thousands of light years away. If youF
Fhave any common sense, you wonft push it. F
h.......Nuclear missles??
 What the heckfre those?h
hI wonder...
 I donft know what Planet Kurupiston is either...h
hTherefs a bunch of words I donft understand, so I donft
 really get it, but if you tell me not to push it if I
 have common sense, Ifm really gonna want to push it.
 Fufufufufufufu.h
hI wonder what this button is?h
hWhy donft you push it if youfre curious?h
h....Hmm, I donft think so.h
Therefs a large button.
Push it?
hAlright, Ifm pushing it.h
(Push)
I pushed the button in with my thumb.
h..........h
h..............h
h..........h
hNothingfs happening, Rance-sama.h
hYeah, how boring.h
Rance and Šó˜I knew nothing about it, but at that
time.....
Planet Kurupiston was annihilated by a nuclear missile
that appeared out of nowhere.
The planet died along with its billions of Kurupiston
residents, but this was a trivial event having nothing to
do with this story.
hRance-sama, Mariafs inside that giant Puryo!h
Maria Custard is trapped inside the Puryo.
hLetfs save her, Rance-sama.h
hGeez, what a troublesome woman.h
I raised the •—­“jEÒ and slashed at the giant Puryo.
(Slash slash slash)
The giant Puryo tore like a balloon before my wonderful,
flowing strikes.
hGahahahahahahahahahaha!
 Easy win!h
hRance-sama, Maria-san...!h
hYep.h
I approached Maria, who stood silently where the giant
Puryo disappeared.
hHey, Maria.
 I came to save you.h
h.......h
hHey, whatfs up?h
hRance-sama, somethingfs wrong.h
hHey, Maria.h
hWhat the fuckfs wrong with her?h
hRance-sama, Maria-san...h
hWhat is it?h
hMaybe she was stuck inside the Puryo for too long, and
 her body was possessed by them?h
hWhat? Can that happen?h
hYes.
 The Puryofs appetite can take over a personfs body and
 make them eat until they die.h
hSeriously? Okay, letfs look for Maria.h
hYes.h
But no matter how much I cut, the giant Puryo kept
regenerating, so I couldnft save her.
h...........h
hRance-sama.h
hFarewell, Maria.
 Ifll keep an image of your plump body in my memory
 forever.h
hRance-samaaa, are you abandoning Maria-san?
 You canft do that, I wonft let you!h
hWhat the hell do you want me to do? Itfs impossible!h
....But I canft really abandon her. Thatfd be too sad.
Letfs think of a way to save her.
Shefs one of my precious women after all, yep.
hRance-sama, itfs åQf-san!h
åQf-san is trapped inside a giant Puryo.
hAlright, Ifm gonna save her.h
I raised the •—­“jEÒ and slashed at the giant Puryo.
hUryayayayayayayayaya!!h
(Slash slash slash slash)
The •—­“jEÒ, which normally has almost no worth in
combat, displayed wonderful cutting ability here.
hUryaaaa, die, die, diiie!!h
The Puryo burst open and disappeared.
hGahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!
 Ifm invincible!h
hAmazing, Rance-sama!
 *Clap* *clap* *clap*!h
hOh, åQf-san.
 Rescue, rescue.h
I approached åQf-san with grabby hands.
When I got close to her to embrace her, åQf-san woke uo
on her own.
hUgh.. phew.
 You saved me.h
h—¢....h
hIfm glad youfre safe, åQf-dono.h
hYeah, you too, —¢...h
hLeila-san!h
hŠó˜I-chan! Rance-kun must be here too then!
 Thatfs great. We found you.h
hI saved you, you know.
 You better thank me.h
hThanks, Rance-kun.h
hHrm. I expect a different kind of thanks than words, but
 for now, get on back to town.h
hUnderstood.
 Then Ifll see you later.h
I sent Leila-san back to town with a Return Wood.
hRance-sama, Ifm glad Leila-sanfs okay.h
hYeah.h
(Thwack thwack thwack)
hShit, no matter how much I cut, it keeps regenerating!h
hRance-sama, I donft think a giant Puryo can be defeated
 with regular methods.h
hThen what kinda irregular method do we need?h
h....Maybe we have to defeat it using a mysterious drug,
 or a mysterious item, or a mysterious weapon?h
hArgh, what a pathetic idea! Relying on a random item?
 Ifm gonna do this until I think of something better!h
I pushed Šó˜I down right there and suddenly thrusted into
her from behind.
hAh...!h
hPunishment, punishment, punishment!h
(Ram thrust ram thrust thrust thrust thrust)
hAh..!h
hAhn... *gasp*..!h
............
hHow are we going to save Leila-san then, Rance-sama?h
hWell, letfs look for some kinda special item.
 We probably need something like that to defeat the giant
 Puryo.h
h........
 ...Thatfs exactly what I just...h
hHm? fD you say something?h
hNo. Of course, Rance-sama.
 What a brilliant idea.h
hYep, gahahahahahahahahahahahaha!h
hRance-sama, itfs Kanami-san!h
hTake that, and that!h
Kentou Kanami is getting pushed back to the wall,
resisting to the end.
hAnd that, and that, haah....h
hI canft... go on...h
hRance-sama, Kanami-sanfs...!h
hI know.
 Letfs go!!h
Therefs a button on the slate.
Push it?
(Push)
I pushed the button.
There are fresh Î”ÂÄ“y“¤es in the field.
hOh, Î”ÂÄ“y“¤es.
 They look good.h
hYou like them too, Leila-san?
 I love them.h
hJulia likes fem too!h
hMm, delicious.h
hYeah, you canft stop eating even if you know theyfll
 make you gain weight.h
hThat just sounds mean coming from you, u—¥. Youfre
 so thin. You know my weight bothers me.h
hYoufre cuter chubby, Maria.h
...No waaay...
hHey, dfyou want some too, —¢-san?h
hNo, Ifm on a mission now, so Ifll pass.h
hOh, donft be so stiff. Theyfre good, you know.h
hActually, I donft really like Î”ÂÄ“y“¤es....h
hBut theyfre so good.. how strange.h
hJuliafs gonna eat another one!h
There are a bunch of delicious-looking ”Ñ’c growing in
the field.
hWow, look at all the ”Ñ’c!
 The ones on these pink branches must have plums in
 them.h
hThese green branches are salmon-filled.h
hJulia wants a yogurt-filled one!
 I donft see any.. awww.h
There are cute girl-shaped plants growing in this field.
hWhatfs this weird plant?h
hI wonder if this is a ™Ö“¿f‘?h
hDo you know what it is, Leila-san?h
hYes, I read about them in a book about monster plants
 when I was a child.
 Theyfre plants that are used for magic, and when you
 pull them out, they let out terrible screams.h
hIf a human pulls out a ™Ö“¿f‘ and hears its scream
 directly, theyfll die.
 Thatfs why humans use other creatures to pull them out.h
hTheyfre such cute plants, but I guess theyfre pretty
 dangerous, huh?
 We probably shouldnft get too close.h
hJulia wants one fcause theyfre cute!h
hNo way. Donft touch them if you donft want to die.h
hBooooo.h
There are Î”ÂÄ“y“¤es sprouting in the field.
Take one?
There are fresh, warm Î”ÂÄ“y“¤es sprouting in the
field.
hCan Julia eat one more?h
hNope.h
hMeanie, youfre mean, Captain Leila!h
We already have one 
,
so we donft need another one.
We donft need more than one stupid 
.
I took one Î”ÂÄ“y“¤.
There are ”Ñ’c sprouting in the field.
Take one?
There are a bunch of different kinds of ”Ñ’c sprouting
in the field.
hThere arenft any yogurt-filled ones even though theyfre
 Juliafs favorite.. boohoo.h
We already have one 
,
so we donft need another one.
We donft need more than one stupid 
.
I took one ”Ñ’c.
There are ™Ö“¿f‘ sprouting in the field.
Take one?
The dangerous plants, ™Ö“¿f‘, are sprouting in the
field.
hWhat are those Magic Farmers thinking growing such
 dangerous plants?h
hThey probably arenft.h
We already have one 
,
so we donft need another one.
We donft need more than one stupid 
.
h........h
hWait a second, Maria. Isnft that dangerous?h
hYeah, but....
 We need to bring one to the Magic Farmer...h
hYou should just ignore them!
 We donft really need to do their stupid errands.h
The ™Ö“¿f‘ swayed back and forth, smiling.
hWe could just get one of the Magic Farmers around here
 to pull it out for us....h
(Pop..... Kyaaiin)
Julia casually pulled out a ™Ö“¿f‘.
hJulia, you idiot.. What have you..?
 Youfll die!h
h....Ifm fine!
 See?h
Mysteriously, Julia did appear to be fine.
And we didnft hear the terrible scream Leila-san
described when she pulled it out...
hHuh, I guess it was just superstition.
 It was definitely in Miyazaza Publishingfs fMonster
 Plant Dictionaryf though.h
hMiyazaza Publishing, eh? Therefs your problem.h
hYoufve heard of them, u—¥?h
hYeah, theyfre famous for writing nothing but lies.
 You were tricked, Leila-san.h
hSo it was a lie that youfll die if you pull out a
 ™Ö“¿f‘, huh? Ifm kinda mad, but I guess all that
 matters is that Juliafs okay.h
Obtained ™Ö“¿f‘.
(Pop.... kyaaiin)
I took a ™Ö“¿f‘.
hLooks like somethingfs stuck.h
I stuck my hand in the aqueduct and felt around.
(Fish fish fish)
hOh.....h
hDonft be so reckless, Maria!h
hItfs fine. Nnnnh.h
hAha, there it is!h
I pulled a red helmet out of the aqueduct.
hOh, my fmet!h
hSo this was stuck in there.h
—¢-san took his helmet and quickly put it on.
hI am terribly sorry for causing you trouble.
 I will do everything I can to make it up to you.h
hJulia likes the cute —¢-chan better though.h
hWell, wefve got —¢-san back now, so letfs get going on
 our search for Rance-kun again.h
hI suppose so.
 But maybe we should take care of those Helman guys
 first.h
hAnyway, letfs keep working hard.h
Itfs an aqueduct.
The Magic Farmers are working really hard to make these,
so we shouldnft take any.
Theyfre just in the way. I donft want any produce covered
in dirt in my inventory.
... h!!h
hOh, how cute.h
... hHello, ladies!
     Play with me!h
h*Giggle*, hefs kind of cute.h
hCfmere, cfmere, come play with Julia!h
But when Julia tried to beckon it over, Leila-san stopped
her.
hStop, Julia.
 Donft get near it.h
... h.............h
hBut why? Itfs so cute.
 You play with us too, Captain Leila.h
hYeah. Wefre supposed to be looking for Rance, but itfs
 fine to take a little break, right?h
hDo you want to die?h
hEh?h
hItfs got a cute face, but thatfs a monster called a Lady
 Killer.h
Lady Killer h.....Tch.h
hItfs his fault there was a male barrier on this hallway.
 He was trying to lure in girls.h
hEh? Eh? Eh? Are you serious?h
h.....h
Lady Killer hPlay with me, ladies!
             Ifll tear your skin off nice and clean!h
hWhoa, what a freak!h
Lady Killer hNow, letfs play!!h
The Lady Killer attacked.
hThis isnft working! None of our attacks affect it!h
hI hate this thing!
 Hefs worse than Rance!h
hIt looks like attacks from women donft affect it at all.
 Wefve gotta run.h
Lady Killer hWait, where are you going??
             Play with me!h
hNo way!h
Lady Killer hWait.. Cfmon, cfmon!h
hHe doesnft know when to give up.h
hWhatfs the matter, everyone?h
hAh, —¢-san!
 Please defeat that Lady Killer!h
