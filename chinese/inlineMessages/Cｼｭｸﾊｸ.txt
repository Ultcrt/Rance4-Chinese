I went into u—¥fs and my tent.
Wefre here on a mission, but when I go into a tent like
this, it feels like wefre here for fun.
Well, itfs gotten late.. what should I do?
Nope.
I wonft do it.
Why is this command even here...?
I suppose. Wefve gotta work hard again tomorrow.
Letfs get to sleep.
I got into my sleeping bag.
...Futons are definitely better.
....Ifm tired.
I donft know if it was because I was exhausted, but I
quickly fell into a deep sleep.
Zzzzzzzz.
Zzzzzzzzz.
.............
h*Yawn*.... fMorning, àó—˜ˆŸ.h
hGood morning, u—¥.
 Itfs.. already morning, huh?h
hYup, everyonefs already waiting.
 Cfmon, get up, get up.h
hY- yeah.h
Itfs the beginning of another busy day today.
I hope nobody gets hurt today.
And I want to find —–z soon...
.........
hGood morning, everyone!h
hfMorning.. eh?
 Whatfs that??h
hHeheheheheh, I stayed up all night making it!
 Itfs a helmet for —¢-chan!h
hTh.. that is??h
hYeah. —¢-chanfs weak without his helmet, after all.
 But if he has this, hefll be fine!h
h............h
hWait.. thatfs...h
hHere, —¢-chan, itfs a present!h
hHahahaha, thank you.h
From now on, this tent will be our lodgings.
The tent wefve set up using the remains of the Tulip #4
is divided into three sections.
One tent is —¢-sanfs, since hefs a man.
åQf-san, éä»‰ë-san, and ‰Á“Ş”ü-san will take the
biggest tent.
And u—¥ and I will sleep here.
A tent, huh.. itfs kind of exciting.
Ifll use this sleeping bag when I go to bed.
It looks kinda like a bagworm.
hàó—˜ˆŸ.h
hWhat is it, u—¥?h
hWhat do you mean, fwhatf?
 Wefre having a meeting.h
......Meeting taking place..........
...................
hAnd thatfs that.h
hThen wefll start our search for —–z and Sill-chan
 tomorrow.
 Letfs do our best, everyone.h
hYeah.h
héä»‰ëfll do her best too!h
åQf-san took center stage and quickly went through what
wefll be doing today and after today.
Dinner was being prepared by ‰Á“Ş”ü-san and u—¥
today, so I wandered around aimlessly on a walk.
h.........h
hOh, my glasses fogged up.
 *Wipe* *wipe*....h
hàó—˜ˆŸ-san?h
hYes... åQf-san?h
hWhat are you doing by yourself?h
hI just donft have anything to do....
 u—¥ told me to come up with a plan for tomorrow
 since Ifm the leader, but..h
hI...h
hIfm sorry, àó—˜ˆŸ-san.
 That we kind of forced you into the position.h
hIt really should have been me or —¢-san, since wefre
 Leazas soldiers, but...h
hNo, itfs fine.
 Itfs just.. Ifm not very confident.....h
hThe wind feels nice, huh?
 Letfs sit for a bit.h
hHeh...?h
hLetfs chat.
 I havenft talked to you much, àó—˜ˆŸ-san.h
I chatted with åQf-san for a while.
hHmmm, is that so?
 So youfve known —–z since then?h
hYeah... since the.. since our master Ragishssf
 conspiracy...h
hIfll change the topic a bit.
 àó—˜ˆŸ-san, do you have someone you like?h
hOf course, not.
 No one wants to be with a girl like me.h
hOh, didnft you know?
 You and u—¥-san are really popular among the young
 Leazas knights.h
h......h
hA lot of people have come to me asking to be introduced
 to you.
 Theyfre all knights with guaranteed brilliant futures.
 Any of fem would be marrying into money.h
hNo way.. with someone like me..?h
hYoufre wrong about yourself, you know.
 Be more confident.h
h....But.. —–z said...h
h—–z? Did —–z say something?h
h........h
hàó—˜ˆŸ-san, could it be that you like..?h
hNo.. of course I... donft.h
h...........h
hDoes —–z interest you?h
hHefs a brute and a horrible man... but, I.. Ifve been
 saved by him twice now...h
h.......h
hTherefs no way I could like him.
 But....h
h...But...h
hHe does.. interest me a little...
 Thatfs it.h
hHmmm, sounds difficult.
 But hefs a pretty good guy, donft you think?h
hNo way.. that jerk?h
hThere arenft any other guys as honest as him.h
hDo you like —–z, åQf-san?h
hWhat are you getting all serious for?
 I like someone else.h
hWho is it?h
hThatfs a secret.
 But it seems like he has feelings for Maris-san.
 He wonft even look at me.h
h.......h
hBut I wonft lose.
 Life is short. Youfve gotta grab the man you love..
 donft you think so, àó—˜ˆŸ-san?h
hI.... donft understand.
 Love.....h
What I talked about with åQf-san bothered me that night
and I couldnft really get to sleep.
—–z, huh.....
Hefs a horrible guy... but...
..........
...
...
Then, morning came.
