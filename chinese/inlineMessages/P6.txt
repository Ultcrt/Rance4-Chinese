hIfm hoooome!h
Julia returned from her training with the Hanny King.
hGreetings, Rance.
 Good morning.h
h........h
hWho the hell are you??
 I donft know you!!h
hAre you trying to tell me youfve forgotten about a great
 Helman Councilman like me!?
 Your stupidity is astounding!h
hGrrr!h
hOh, the Helman Army commander?
 Ifd completely forgotten about the ugly little man who
 doesnft even come up to my eye level!h
h.....This man....h
hSo? What do you want, greeting me in town like this?
 A fight?h
hOf course not!
 Ifve come to make a deal.
 A deal, you see.h
hI donft make deals with men.h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!
 Oh, just listen, itfs not a bad deal.h
h..............
 If itfs a bad deal, Ifll kill you. Got it?h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!
 Ifd like the keys youfre carrying.h
hKeys?h
hYes, the N Key and the S Key.
 Itfs not like therefs any point to them if youfve only
 got two, right?h
hI guess so. Then why donft you give me the W Key and the
 E Key?
 Ifll use them efficiently.h
hI donft mind giving them to you, but what would you give
 me in exchange?h
hWell, letfs see. I could give you death.h
hKehya, kehya!h
hI have no need for such a thing.
 But I could give you something good.h
hWhat are you doing, Bitch?h
Bitch bound Iofs hands behind her back and restrained
her.
hYoufve got a grudge against this woman, right?
 How about it? Ifll give her to you.h
hWhat!?h
hTwo useless keys or this woman.
 Which is more valuable to you?h
h........h
These keys are useless unless youfve got all four of
them.
.....Hmmmm.
And Io tricked me, so Ifd like to punish her.
What should I do?
Well, I definitely want Io.
And I want the four keys too.
Ifve gotta get those two keys from Bitch in order to
obtain all four of them.
Itfd be quickest just to kill him and take them.
Wait a second. Wouldnft it be just as easy as stealing
two keys to steal four from him?
If Ifm just gonna take fem from him later, then I might
as well give fem to him now.
Yep, Ifm a genius.
What a great idea.
Alright, letfs accept the deal.
hVery well.
 Ifll accept your trade.h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!h
I traded the two keys for Io.
hBitch, you really....h
hKehya, kehya, kehya!h
h........h
hHu, is this.. r-really, okay..?h
h.......h
hThen the deal is complete.
 Letfs both be satisfied with what wefve obtained.h
And with that, Bitchfs group left.
hRance, those keys were important....
 Now what are we gonna do?h
hShefs right, Rance-dono.
 How could you give them to those Helman....h
hWefll just take them all back later.
 Nothinf to worry about.h
hBut....h
hWefre just letting Bitch hold onto them for now.
 Right, just for a little while.h
hNow then....h
I looked at Io and grinned.
h.......h
I took Io straight to the SM Room.
h..............h
I silently lined up some whips and candles on the table.
h......Umm, I..
 had orders, so..h
It looks like Iofs pretty scared.
hNothinf to do with me.
 Doesnft change the fact that you tricked me.h
hIfm just not satisfied if I donft get back at the people
 whofve wronged me.h
hFor something like this, a fitting estimate of a
 punishment would be..
 capital punishment.h
h*Gasp*...!h
hI might stab you or cut you up with my sword, torturing
 you to death.h
hNo.. please forgive me!
 Ifm begging you, spare me!h
hHmmm, well, letfs see.h
hPlease, spare me.
 Ifll do whatever you say for the rest of my life!h
hWell, itfs not like Ifm completely without compassion.
 If you were a man, youfd be dead already, but Ifll let
 you off with this.h
I spread my hands out in front of Io.
hTen rounds.
 At least ten.h
h........I understand.h
hNow letfs get to it!
 Ifm gonna punish you so that youfll never disobey me
 again!h
I stripped Io and began her super punishment.
.........One hour later......
After my pitiless, merciless assault, the cocky, lying Io has been
reduced to a pathetic, powerless little girl.
Hands and feet bound, Io was thoroughly tortured by me, and her
secret place had already been directly attacked by my destructive
weapon four times.
Then I stuck a super-sized vibrator into her gooey mess of a vagina
and stuck a magic-powered egg-shaped vibrator in her ass.
Then I tied her up into all sorts of embarrassing poses with a rope,
gave her some persistent verbal abuse, and struck her a few times
with a whip.
Even Ifd get a little tired from all this.
She must be regretting deceiving me after all of this punishment.
I guess I can forgive her soon.
Io hNo, Ifm begging you, please stop already!h
Rance h..........h
Io had surrendered completely, but when she started meekly pleading,
I got turned on again.
Ifll forgive her, but Ifve gotta have some more fun first.
Rance hYoufre so sweet, Io-chan.
       But this punishmentfs only just gotten started.h
I took the whip in my hand and grinned down at Io.
Rance hNow then, what would you like me to do next?h
hWell, Ifm done punishing Io.
 What a refreshing morning.h
hI think wefve stayed in this town long enough,
 Rance-sama.
 Ifd like to return to the surface soon.h
hYeah, all the girls in the world are waiting for me after
 all.h
(Sway)
hHm...?h
(Sway sway sway sway sway)
Suddenly the ground started shaking.
hKyaaa, Rance-sama!
 An earthquake! Itfs an earthquake!h
hUgh, ugya, ugya!!h
(Sway sway sway sway)
  (Sway sway sway sway)
     (Sway sway sway sway)
hIfm scared, Rance-sama!
 Whatfs going to happen!!?h
hOh.. owawah..!h
hW-what if the whole floating continent fell..
 Kyaaa, Ifm scaaared!h
hArgh, stop screaming!
 See? The tremors have already stopped.h
(Sway sway ...)
The tremors gradually weakened to the point where you
could barely feel a slight trembling with your feet.
hYoufre right, itfs not really shaking anymore.h
hIfm sorry for losing my composure, Rance-sama.h
hJust calm down, you loser.
 But itfs not like theyfve completely stopped.
 Itfs still shaking a tiny bit.h
hRance-sama!h
hWhat is it?h
hDo you think the whole continent is moving?h
hThe clouds are moving faster, and itfs windier, too...h
h...........
 I dunno whether itfs moving or not, but somethingfs
 definitely going on.h
hItfs that piece of shit... Uhh, what was his name
 again?h
hBitch-san?h
hYeah, yeah, that Bitch guy.
 That asshole mustfve used those four keys to do
 something.h
hYes, probably.h
hWell, Ifm done fucking Io, so letfs go kill him.
 He should be in the place where you use those keys.h
hYes, the underground control room.h
hRight. Then letfs go.h

Upsilon hIt seems that some rather low-class monsters
         have been breeding inside my body while Ifve
         been asleep.h

A multitude of Hitlers appeared before Upsilon.

hWefre ready to go, Rance-sama.h

We heard screams from somewhere behind us.
hWhat is it?h
hItfs monsters, Rance-sama!
 Monsters are attacking the town!h
hAttacking civilians!?
 We must eliminate them at once!h
hOh no... Monsters, in a place like this!?h
hShit, fucking monsters!
 Doing whatever the hell they waaaaant!!h
hThis townfs mine!
 Attacking itfs the same as attacking me!h
hWhen did it.. become your town, Rance!?
 This is no time for that!h
hRance-sama!h
hYeah, letfs go destroy those monsters!h
We headed towards the monsters attacking the town.

hShit... Therefs too many of fem, Grandpa!h
hI can see that!
 Your father had the guts to face down an entire army by
 himself, you know!h
hDonft cry over something like this if youfre his son!h
hTch, I just donft want to die in vain!
 I donft want to die over something stupid like warriorfs
 pride.. like my father...!h
hThen do you think Dens died in vain?h
h..................h
h...He did.... Of course he did.....
 Dying to save someone like me...?h
hYou must have at least one person youfd give your life
 to protect!h
h.................h
hYes.. Thatfs all it is....h

hGahahahahahaha, easy, too easy!h
When Ifd defeated the monsters and was taking a little
break, Kiseda approached me.
hHaah, haah, haah, haah.h
hRance-san, please help!
 Monsters have appeared at the east entrance of the
 town!h
hWhat, are you serious!?
 Fucking hell!h
hItfs the end! Wefre done for!
 Everyonefs gonna die!h
hYa know, ya know, ya know!h
hStop wailing.
 Just fight! Fight and kill the monsters!h

hYoufre such fucking wimps!h
hLetfs go, Sill!
 Wefre intercepting those monsters!h
hYes!h
hGahahahahahaha, easy win, easy, win!
 Bring fem on!h
hHaah, haah.h
hWhat the hell was easy about that? Geez.h
h....Ifm tired.h
hThere are monsters over there, ya know!
 Ifm scared, ya know!h
hWhy donft you fucking fight instead of sit around being
 all scared with your stupid shiny face?
 Men who donft fight are trash you know!h
h....I donft care if Ifm trash, ya know.
 Ifm scared, ya know.h
hAnyway, letfs go.
 We wonft let any of the monsters who came to town go
 back to their nests!
 Wefre killing 100% of them!h
hPhew......h
hLooks like the monsters are done attacking for now.h
hGeez, what the hellfs going on?h

–    Research Core  Freak       –
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
hIfm impressed. You complain a lot, but youfre still
 swinging your sword, arenft you?h
hYou should talk, Grandpa. Youfre too good to be an old
 man already.h
hGahaha, Ifm just getting started.....
 I must take revenge for Replica as well....h
h....................h
h...Cfmon, Grandpa.. Donft you think itfs about time you
 told me... about this Toushin Toshi, and.. about who you
 really are....?h
h...................h
h...How much has that Merim girl told you? ...h
hJust that this thing was a weapon...
 What I want to know is what you have to do with it,
 Grandpa.h
h....................h
h..Very well.. Listen closely.. and, you.. think too....
 about what to do from now on.h
h???h
hI imagine youfve noticed already, but Ifm a Tousho like
 Dio and Replica, a relic from the past.h
hAnd that ridiculously giant thing you saw earlier was a
 Toushin.. Toushin ƒ² [Upsilon].h
hThat giant monster is a temporary form of [Sergio], one
 of the 24 central members of the Holy Magic Sect who
 built this Toushin Toshi.h
hSon of Toma... I am the man who was supposed to become
 the 24th of those monsters, Toushin ƒ¶ [Omega]...h
h...................
 Could you not become a Toushin, Grandpa?
 ...h
hNo... I.. I wanted to die while I still retained my own
 will..h
hI didnft want to be controlled, even if it was by one of
 my closest friends.h
hYour friend?h
hYes.. A true hero, named M. M. Rune, who tried to free
 humanity from the rule of the Demon King.h
hIfve heard of him. The legendary mage who formed the
 Holy Magic Sect... So you were buds with a guy like
 that, Grandpa? Thatfs cool.h
h...Yes.. Indeed.. We were friends..
 Because we were friends.. it was because we were
 friends that.... I... I killed him....h
h! ...Grandpa............
 The traitorous mage in the legends...
 That was you.....?h
h....................h
hThere was no other way.. to stop his Toushin after hefd
 lost himself in rage and couldnft tell friend from foe
 any longer......h
hI sealed all of the remaining Toushin, who couldnft
 function any longer after losing their master.h
hWhy? ..Why didnft you destroy them...?h
hDid you think once theyfd calmed down, theyfd stop
 trying to fulfill the last order theyfd received...?h
hSo you tried to stop Bitch because you knew this would
 happen!h
h..Yes... But, one day..
 When humanity is once again fighting the Dark Lords..h
hI thought these Toushin Toshi.. would come in useful...
 Surely....h
hIf I could figure out how to completely control a
 Toushin....
 Ifve been researching, trying to find a method to do so
 for the last few hundred years....h
hIfll inherit...
 Runefs will...h
h...Phew, what an extraordinary story. Therefs nothing a
 guy like me can do even if I hear about it..
 Hahah...h
h....................h
h....................h
hGrandpa, what do we do about the Toushin thatfs been
 activated?h
h.......Shit. If Ifd just killed that Bitch bastard when
 I had the chance, this wouldnft have happened... Shit!h
hItfs my responsibility. I should have explained
 everything from the start....h
hCanft anything be done now?h
hWefve got to do something......
 For the time being, wefll have to deal with the girl
 being used as his power source...h
hThat huge crystal ball thing, right..?
 I donft think we can get there surrounded by all these
 monsters though.h
hThatfs the problem. *Sigh*... This is trouble.h
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
– And Rancefs group, who have     –
–   defeated the monsters.        –
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
hPhew, looks like wefve beaten them all.
 That was irritating.h
hThat was hard, wasnft it, Rance-sama?h
hShit, that fuckinf Biggs!h
hItfs Bitch, Rance-sama.h
hWhatever. Since hefs wronged me, he must die.h
hWefre raiding the Underground Control Area where he is.
 Everyone, follow me!h
hBut Rance-sama, what will happen to the town if we all
 go?h
hWhat if monsters attack again while wefre gone?
 Wefve got to protect them somehow...h
hI donft really care what happens to this town.
 But I guess itfs got some cute girls worth protecting.h
hRight! Thatfs right, Rance-sama!
 Youfre absolutely right, Rance-sama!h
hLetfs see. Maria, Leila, and Julia.. You guys stay here
 and protect the town.h
hIfd like to say fleave it to us,f but honestly, I donft
 think we can do it by ourselves.h
hYeah, we canft!
 We need more people, cfmon, cfmon!h
hRance, Ifll stay with them.
 Thatfs fine, isnft it?h
hSure.h
hThen Ifll stay too.
 Or do you want me with you, Rance?h
hI donft need you, you dumbass.
 You stay here too, Shizuka.h
hYoufll be fine with this many people, right, Maria?h
hYeah.h
hAlright. Sill, Kanami, Rick, and Merim.
