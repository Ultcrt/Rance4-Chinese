...A monster attacked.
Leave the room?
Looks like a normal table.
Hm, thereÅfs a note on top of the desk.
LetÅfs see.
ÅF Attack Directive 0344     ÅF
ÅF  Intercept the Demon Army ÅF
ÅF  as it advances northward.ÅF
ÅhLooks like a note from when this Toushin Toshi was at
 war.Åh
ItÅfs a giant mirror.
But itÅfs clouded.
ÅhHmph, what a cheap mirror.Åh
ItÅfs a slate.
ThereÅfs a bunch of buttons on it for some reason.
ÅhLooks like a deep hole.
 DonÅft trip again, Sill.Åh
ÅhYes, Rance-sama.
 IÅfll be careful.Åh
ÅhItÅfs a deep hole, Rance-sama.Åh
Åh.......Look!Åh
ÅhKya!Åh
I shoved SillÅfs ass as a little tiny joke, but she lost
her balance and fell into the hole.
ÅhHey, Sill!!Åh
.....
....
ÅhSiiiill, answer me!!Åh
When I got up close to the hole and yelled down it, a
weird thing popped out of it.
KD ÅhI am King Dragon!
    KD, for short.Åh
ÅhSill!!Åh
Pink Sill ÅhRance-sama!!Åh
Blue Sill ÅhMaster!!Åh
*Sigh*.. What the fuckÅfs this about?
KD ÅhIs this pink-haired slave the one you dropped?
    Or is it this blue-haired slave?Åh
ÅhThat blue one.Åh
ÅhEhh? Rance-sama, IÅfm over here!!Åh
KD ÅhYou want this one?Åh
ÅhYeah.Åh
ÅhRance-sama, please donÅft abandon me!
 Rance-samaaa....!Åh
Åh........Åh
ÅhRance-sama, IÅfll do anything! IÅfll stay with you
 forever!
 So please donÅft say that!Åh
KD ÅhYou want this blue one?Åh
ÅhHmm, wait a second.
 I may be wrong.Åh
KD ÅhThink carefully about this now.Åh
ÅhTheyÅfre both mine.Åh
KD Åh.......Lying is wrong, you know.
    You only get to choose one.Åh
KD ÅhNow think carefully and choose.Åh
Åh...That pink slave.
 SheÅfs a little worn out, but sheÅfs mine.Åh
ÅhRance-sama!!Åh
KD ÅhHmmm? Then donÅft lose her again, eh?Åh
KD disappeared after handing the pink-haired Sill to me.
ÅhThat was scary, Rance-sama.Åh
Sill clung to me.
ÅhHmph, klutz.. Maybe I shoulda taken the opportunity to
 pick that new, blue-haired one.Åh
ÅhRance-samaaa..Åh
ÅhFufufufu, youÅfd better work harder to serve me if you
 donÅft want to be thrown out.Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
ÅhGet really good at cleaning, laundry, and cooking.Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
ÅhKeep yourself clean.
 Maintain these proportions.Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
ÅhListen to anything I say, no matter what it is.Åh
ÅhYes.Åh
ÅhAlright, very well.
 There are infinite replacements for you, you know.
 I hope you understand.Åh
ÅhYes, Rance-sama.
 IÅfll do my best.Åh
