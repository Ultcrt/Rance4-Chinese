hKehya, kehya!h
hWhat? fD you go insane after hearing about your pitiful
 fate?h
hKehya, kehya!

(Shove)
Bitch shoved the glasses girl over to me.
hKyan..!h
The glasses girlfs soft body hits me.
Man, shefs so small it feels like shefd break if I poked
her.
How cute.
hRance-sama, theyfre..!h
hKehya, kehya, then letfs meet again!h
Bitch and ˆÉ‰œ fled while my attention was on the girl with
the glasses.
h............h
hYour comrades betrayed you, huh...?
 Thatfs pretty sad.h
h.....Ifm not surprised.
 Ifm just a tool to Bitch-sama...h
hLetfs kill fer!h
hShefs a Helman soldier.
 Letfs kill her.h
hWe donft kill cute girls, éä»‰ë.
 Thatfs my policy.h
hBut shefs the enemy!h
hAll cute girls become prisoners of war.
 Thatfs the rule.h
hAnyway, youfre gonna be my prisoner.h
hOkay.h
hThatfs right. Your name.
 What is it?h
hItfs Merim Zahl.h
hAnyway, wefve obtained a prisoner of war, so letfs go
 back to town.h
hGood idea, Rance-sama.
 We might be able to get some information from her.h
hTherefs no fmightf about it. You use any method you can
 to get information. Heheheheheh.h
I captured Merim the prisoner of war and returned to
town.
Freon hOh? A new friend?h
hThis bitch?h
I dragged Merim in.
hHello!h
hShefs a prisoner of war.
 Wefre gonna have a fun interrogation now.h
Freon hOh my, that doesnft sound very pleasant.h
I imagined all the fun things I was gonna do in my head.
Inerrogation|„She doesnft talk.
Torture|„She still doesnft talk.
Dirtier and dirtier torture.... Uhihihihihihihi!
hWhat is it, Rance-sama?
 Did you think of something good..?h
hNah, itfs nothing.h
hIfm borrowing the room then.h
hWell then, letfs begin our interrogation.h
hRance-dono, she may be an enemy officer, but I believe
 we should spare her an overly brutal interrogation.h
hHeheh, well thatfll depend on her now, wonft it?
 Itfll be more fun if she resists as much as possible.h
hNow then, whatfs the Helman Armyfs mission here?h
hInvestigation of the Toushin Toshi.h
hOur goal is to obtain the ancient weapon, Toushin Toshi,
 and use it in the next war with Leazas.h
h.......h
hWho are the members of the Helman Army exploration
 team?h
hThe team consists of five peopleF the leader, Helman
 Councilor Bitch, the knight, ‹x”Œ“Á-san, the warrior,
 Dens-san, the mage, ˆÉ‰œ-san, and me.h
h.........h
hYou guys were rõing for keys.
 What are these keys?h
hThe keys are needed to move this Toushin Toshi.
 The N Key, the “ì•”èoú, the “Œ•”èoú, and the W Key...
 With all four of these keys, you should be able to move
 the Toushin Toshi.h
hHow many keys have you Helman guys gathered?h
hTwo, the “Œ•”èoú and the W Key.
 We havenft found the other two yet.h
h........h
hSo why were you destroying that door?h
hWe were destroying it so that the people from Leazas
 couldnft get to the Defense Core.h
hWe only managed to destroy the door, not the transport
 device inside, so you should be able to move freely to
 the Defense Core at this time.h
hAnything else?h
hWait a second, youfre a Helman soldier, arenft you?
 Can you just blab all this classified information like
 this?h
h......h
hWell, Ifm not a soldier, so.h
hEh?h
hIfm a civilian.
 I was working in Bitch-samafs mansion, but he brought me
 along because I know a lot about archaeology.h
hSo.. well.. are soldiers not supposed to talk about that
 stuff?h
h...Yeah.h
hDid I.. say some things I shouldnft have?
 ....Well, whatever.h
hWell, I guess itfs fine.
 But I was looking forward to using this.. for the
 interrogation... ooooh...h
hOh no, why are you crying?h
...What are you gonna do about this whip and these
candles and this daikon I was gonna use to torture you
for a just purpose..? Geez.
...Ifll just find some random reason to assault her
later. Yeah, Ifll put up with it for that.
Shefs my prisoner of war, so I can do what I want with
her.
hWhatever.
 The interrogationfs over.h
hUmm...h
hWhat is it?h
hCould I join you guys?h
hHuh?h
hSince Bitch-sama abandoned me..
 Ifve got nowhere to return to.h
hIfll do whatever I can to help, so please let me join
 you.h
hAlright, fine.h
hRance-dono, though she may be a civilian, she was still
 a member of the enemyfs group.
 It could be dangerous to trust her carelessly.h
hItfs fine.
 Cute girls donft lie.h
h.........h
I decided to let Merim join the party.
But we already have five members, so itfs only as a
spare.
If I want to add Merim to the party, Ifll have to change
the party composition here at the diner.
