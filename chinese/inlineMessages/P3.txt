1,500 meters above Leazas
  Aboard the flying ship, the Tulip #4

hHiya, itfs Lia-chan!
 How are youuu?h
hCurrently cruising with favorable conditions.h
hThat sounds nice, Lia wanted to go too.
 *boop*.. *beep* *boop* *boop*.....h
hWhat is it, Lia-sama..?h
(Bzz bzz bzz bzz bzz)
hWhat is it, Maria? Did you make contact?h
hThe magic transmission was interrupted...
 It looks like therefs a barrier up around here.h
hHmm, thatfs annoying.
 More importantly, this thing is kinda freaking me out..
 Is it really gonna be okay?h
hOf course.h
hIfm gonna speed it up!
 Hirara Engine Output 118%!h
The Tulip #4 accelerated faster and faster.
hHey, Maria!
 S.. slow down a bit..!h
hFly.. fly.. my Tulip!
 Enginefs doing great!h
hI canft... do this... eee...!h
hAre you listening, Maria!?
 Slow it down a little!h
hHard to starboard!h
hKyahahahahaha, kyahahahahahaha!h
hHard to port!h
hKyahahahahahaha, kyahahahahahaha..!h
hEee.....!h
I sped the Tulip #4 up as much as I could.
Flying in the sky sure feels nice.
hOh, I see it!h
The giant island of Ylapu appeared in front of the Tulip
#4 as it cut through the clouds.
hW-wow.h
h...So thatfs Ylapu.
 Itfs really huge.h
hIt looks like there are some manmade buildings.
 Ifm getting kinda excited!h
hSo thatfs where —–z is?h
hYeah, that idiotfs.. there.h
hThen could you land, Maria-dono?h
hYeah, I wanted to fly around a little more and check it
 out, but itfs gotten kinda windy, so letfs hurry.h
The Tulip #4 approached Ylapu, decelerating.
hSpeed, 18 knots.. Progress is stable...
 Ifm gonna land near the biggest tower, okay?h
hLand wherever you want, just do it fast!!h
(Put...)
(Put... put.... putt.. putput..)
hMaria, whatfs that weird noise..??h
hHuh? Looks like itfs not doing so well...h
hWait, itfs fnot doing wellf..? No way..!h
(Rattle... put... putputputputputputputput)
The Tulip #4 let out some smoke and started shaking
violently.
hAhaha, looks like itfs broken.. well this is an issue..h
hKyaaaaa!h
hNo way... this canft be!
 I still havenft gotten to wear cute clothes and
 makeup..!h
hBut Ifll make sure it lands one way or another!
 Hard to starboard!h
(Snap)
hAh.. the wheel broke too...h
h......h
The Tulip #4 plummeted to Ylapu, spouting flames.
.................

...(Thuuud)....

..................
.................
hUh.. uuhn...h
hOww.. Looks like I survived.
 What about everyone else?h
I glanced around the area, my back throbbing in pain.
hGuys..!h
hNo way, you guys are.. alive, right?
 u—¥, answer me!h
h.................h
hOh no, what if everyone.. because my Tulip #4 crashed..
 What.. what.. what do I...h
(Rustle)
hWefre alive, Maria.
 Geez, that was pretty terrible though.h
hu—¥!h
hSeriously, nothing you make is ever decent... geez.h
hOh u—¥, Ifm so glad youfre okay!h
hOf course I am.
 I wonft die until I take revenge for my father.h
...Ifm so glad u—¥fs okay.
hWhat about everyone else, u—¥..?h
hTheyfre fine. Theyfre all over there.h
hIfm glad no one was hurt.h
h*Cough*, *cough*, éä»‰ë-chanfs all covered in dust!
 I wanna take a baaath.h
hSo this is Ylapu, huh?
 The Tulip #4 ended up broken, but itfs good that we
 managed to land here at least.h
h...........h
u—¥, Rick-san, åQf-san, Kanami-san, and éä»‰ë-san.
Ifm glad theyfre all okay.
h...But the Tulip #4 broke, so we canft get home now.
 Ifm sorry, everyone.h
hItfs fine, Maria-san.
 Accidents are just part of an adventure.
 But letfs think about what to do next now.h
hShould we make a tent or something? Wefll probably need
 one.h
hRight.
 We donft know what kind of battles wefll be facing from
 now on. If we want to fight at our best, wefll have to
 have a base of operations.h
hYeah, letfs do it, letfs do it!
 Juliafll cheer you guys on so she doesnft get in your
 way!h
We took some materials out of the crashed Tulip #4 and
started setting up a tent.

An image appeared on the surveillance monitor when Merim
operated the device.
hThis is....h
hTch, those Leazas scum have finally found their way
 here.h
hWell, it looks like theyfre all women, and therefs only
 one knight.
 What fools.h
hAre we going to fight them??h
hOf course. Leazas scum have absolutely no value being
 left alive.
 Merim, where are they?h
hIt looks like theyfre near the Supply Core.h
hThen wefre heading out, ‹x”Œ“Á.h
h......h
hIfll make sure those Leazas scum get a taste of my
 power.
 Kehya, kehya, kehya, kehya!h
hHm...? Thatfs...h
hHurry it up, ‹x”Œ“Á.
 Wefre sortieing!h
hIf you donft follow your orders, youfll be
 court-martialed!
 Kehya, kehya, kehya!h
h....I got it.h
hHu, did you, see something?h
hThe Leazas knight I glimpsed in that image.. mightfve
 been..h
h...W-was it, someone, strong?h
hNah.. probably just my imagination.
 Hefs a general, so he probably doesnft act independently
 like this.h
h‹x”Œ“Á, youfre doing an awful lot of mumbling.
 Be quiet.h
hShut it, asshole.h
h‹x”Œ“Á!!h
hI got it, I got it.
 Letfs get going.h
hKuh... damn brat...
 Ifll make sure he finds out one day what it means to
 defy a councilman.h
hPhew, finally finished, eh?h
With everyonefs help (except Juliafs), wefve managed to
complete the tent that will serve as our adventurefs base
of operations.
hMy Tulip #4... became a tent.
 Ifm a little sad.h
h‰c’ning, ‰c’ning!
 Julia likes ‰c’ning!
 Hey, whenfre we gonna have a ‰c’nfire?h
hWefre not going to do that, Julia.
 This isnft fun and games, so make sure you do your job
 as a royal guard seriously.h
hYes, Captain åQf!h
hWell, what are we gonna do now, Maria?h
hWait a second, u—¥, why are you asking me?
 I canft decide that.h
hI guess we havenft picked a leader yet, huh?
 We canft do much before that.h
hThen letfs make Rick-san the leader.
 Hefs a man, after all.h
hNo, I couldnft.h
hWhy not?
 I think youfd be perfect for it, Rick-san.h
hI donft believe that with my position I would be better
 suited to leading us than åQf-dono, the captain of the
 royal guard.
 I believe åQf-dono would be the better leader.h
hWell, I donft think I should do it.
 Isnft the captain of the royal guard the same as a
 commander of the regular army?
 I canft stand above you, Rick-san.h
hWell this is a problem.h
hThen how about someone else...h
Everyonefs gaze settled naturally on Kanami.
hI canft do it.
 A ninja who works in the shadows canft lead.h
h...Thatfs right, Maria-san!
 You be the leader, Maria-san!h
hThatfs right, you did lead the Liberation Army back in
 the war, and no one would complain if you were the
 leader, Maria-san.h
hWait, I canft.. not a big role like that.h
hYeah, I guess itfs gotta be Maria then.h
hYou canft just decide that, u—¥....h
hGood luck, Captain Maria!
 Juliafll do her best!h
Aahn, at some point I ended up becoming the leader.
I donft know if wefll really be okay with me doing this.
