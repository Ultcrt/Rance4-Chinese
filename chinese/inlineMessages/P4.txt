––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––
Today, once again, at the inn where —–z and friends were staying,
Šó˜I found herself being teased.
Šó˜I hNo.. Please stop..!h
Io hOh, but Ifm taking such good care of you..
    So youfre still talking like that, hm?h
Io bit Šó˜Ifs small nipple.
Šó˜I hOw..!h
Io hGirls who donft listen must be punished.
    Right, —–z-san?h
—–z hGahahahahahahahahahaha..!h
I was sprawled out on a chair, observing the goings-on.
Šó˜I hAaaaaaaaaaah!h
Šó˜I-chanfs scream echoes through the inn.
u—¥ h....Gugh......!h
Bitch hKehya, kehya!
       Therefs nothing cuter than a restrained girl with no freedom!h
u—¥ h......Gu.. guh..!h
Bitch hArenft you lucky?
       Ifll teach you what true happiness for a woman is!h
Bitch touched u—¥fs hair.
u—¥ hMmm....!h
u—¥ tried to escape from his dirty-looking hands, but as she was
restrained, it proved to be pointless effort.
Bitch hYou have very nice hair.
       Ifll cut it for you later.h
Bitch hI like short hair, you see.h
Bitch hKehya, kehya, kehya!h
u—¥ hGuh.... mm....!h
Bitch hI see.
       Youfre excited?h
(Slash)
Bitchfs knife quickly cut u—¥fs clothes.
Bitch hWhy donft you show me your cute legs!h
Bitch flipped u—¥fs skirt up.
Bitch hKehya, kehya, kehya!
       What nice thighs, without a scratch on them!h
Bitch caressed u—¥fs thighs, drooling and laughing.
u—¥ h....Mm..!h
Bitchfs dried up hands rubbed u—¥fs thighs, moving higher and
higher up her legs.
u—¥ h....!h
Bitch hI see!
       You want me to touch here?
       Kehya, kehya!h
Bitchfs bone-like hands land on u—¥fs panties.
Bitch h....Hm, what, not having fun?h
Bitch noticed u—¥fs piercing glare.
Bitch hI see. In that case..
       I guess Ifve got no choice.h
Bitch held u—¥fs eyelid open and moved his knife to her eyes.
Bitch hI bet itfd be fun to stick this right into that eyeball.h
u—¥ h.....Mmmm... Mm!h
Bitch hItfs unbelievably easy, you know.
       Itfs just like cutting tofu.h
Bitch hKehya, kehya, kehya!h
(Thud)
Bitch hOwah... kuuunh.h
Bitch swayed and collapsed in front of u—¥ right in the nick of
time.
u—¥ h??????????h
hPhew.....!h
hNn.. nn...!h
hGo, hurry anf, go.h
...While something that serious was happening...
Šó˜I hNo, —–z-sama.. please help me!h
Šó˜I has been cornered by Iofs attacks and her screams echo again.
—–z hYou look good, Šó˜I.
       Are you that happy Iofs touching you?h
Io stuck her hand into Šó˜Ifs panties and used her lewd techniques to
attack Šó˜Ifs pussy.
Šó˜I hAaaaah, n..o..!h
I was having fun playing with Šó˜I together with Io.
(Knock knock)
—–z hWho the hell is it at this time??h
Io hIt could be fun. Letfs let them in.
    Letfs let even more people see this girl being embarrassed.h
Šó˜I hNo.. Please donft!
      —–z-sama, please stop!h
—–z hI suppose it could be fun!
       Hey, itfs open, come on in!h
... hExcuse me.h
Šó˜I hNooooo!h
(Clack)
The door opened.
hExcuse me. Itfs —¢ Addison.h
hIfm éä»‰ë from the Royal Guaaard!
 Ahhh, theyfre doing naughty stuff!h
hKya... no..!h
Apparently it was Leazas soldiers at my door.
But why now..?
When —¢ saw Io, he put a hand on his longsword and took
a combat stance.
hYoufre a Helman soldier....!
 Why are you here..?h
h.........h
h—–z-dono, what is this Helman woman doing here..??h
hHer namefs Io Ishtar.
 Shefs my precious...h
When I had said that much, Šó˜I screamed.
h—¢-san, please!
 This Helman mage cast a spell on —–z-sama and is
 controlling him!h
hWhat are you saying, Sill?h
hPlease, —–z-sama!
 Please open your eyes already!h
hArgh, you idiot!h
(Thwack thwack thwack)
hHm.... what are you doing?h
—¢ stopped my hand, which was hitting Sill.
h—–z-dono, this Helman mage has cast a spell on you.h
hLet go of me, you asshole!h
hPlease rest assured, Sill-dono.
 I will free him from this spell.h
hKuh... you..!h
héä»‰ë doesnft get.. whatfs going on????h
h—–z-san, defeat that man!!
 Hefs my enemy!
 Please?h
hAlright, if Io says so, then sure.
 Ifll kill this loser with his lame, girly red armor!h
h—–z-dono.... stop this.h
—¢ stepped backwards, dodging the sword I swung down at
him.
hDonft run, you coward!h
h—–z-sama, please stop!
 —¢-san is our ally!h
h—–z-san, that man.. kill him!!h
hOkay!
 Ifll do anything you say, my love!h
h—–z-dono.. It looks as though I have no choice.h
Looks like —¢fs finally in the mood to fight me, as
hefs just drawn his sword.
hFinally in the mood, eh?
 Ifll teach you that Leazasf number 1 swordsman is trash
 compared to the worldfs greatest hero, me!h
h—–z-sama, —¢-san!
 Please stop!
 You shouldnft be fighting...!h
hLetfs go!h
(Thwack thwack thwack)
    (Clink clink clink)
  (Smack bam)
hOooohhhn.h
(Thud)
I was defeated.
h—–z-samaaa....!h
hItfs alright, Sill-san.
 Hefs just unconscious.h
h—–z-sama, —–z-sama, —–z-sama..!h
hItfs the end of the line for you, Helman woman.h
h......h
hI canft forgive your cowardly methods.h
hI guess you really are Leazasf number 1 swordsman.
 This —–z was pretty skilled too, you know......h
hItfs too bad.
 I only got one key in the end, but I guess itfll have to
 do.h
Io took the “Œ•”èoú and left through the window.
hWait, donft run!h
hHohohohohoho, letfs meet again!h
After a little while, I woke up.
hKuh... you bastard!h
hRance-sama, are you alright?h
I was defeated in battle by that jerk and now I hurt all
over.
hRance-dono, please forgive my rudeness before.h
hHiyaaa!h
hNo way, next time Ifm gonna fuckinf kill you.h
hRance-sama!h
hWhat, Sill... Donft get in my way.h
hRance-sama, Ifll explain, so please listen.h
h.......h
I understood the majority of what had happened after
Sillfs explanation.
Apparently I was being controlled with Iofs magic.
So —¢ was fighting me to undo that magic, huh... I
guess itfs good that I managed to get out of Iofs spell
because of it, but I still donft like it.
Why do I have to lose to a guy like this?
I canft allow men who are stronger than me to exist.
     One day Ifll kill him in his sleep.
hYoufre Leazas soldiers though, arenft you?
 What the hell are you doing here?h
hYes.
 We received a mission from Princess Lia and came to
 rescue Rance-dono and Sill-san.h
hWe came to save you!h
hLia did, eh...? That stupid princess...?
 Well, I guess thatfs fine.h
hThatfs wonderful, Rance-sama!
 Now we can go home!h
hYeah. I donft like needing these guys to help us out,
 but I am kinda getting bored of this place by now.
 Letfs go home, I guess.h
hWell.....h
hWhat is it, —¢? Something wrong?h
hYes... The thing is...h
—¢ explained to Rance that the Tulip #4 theyfd arrived
on would no longer work and that àó—˜ˆŸ and the others got
caught in a Helman trap and are now missing.
hWhat, àó—˜ˆŸ and u—¥ and ‰Á“Ş”ü and åQf-san are all
 missing..?h
hIfm truly ashamed.h
hWe were all caught in that Helman trap, but somehow only
 éä»‰ë and I managed to escape...h
hYep, thatfs right.h
hRance-sama, letfs go find them.h
hTheyfre all just causing me unnecessary work, the
 losers.. Geez, Ifll rape fem all.h
h—¢, you know where àó—˜ˆŸ and the others went missing,
 right?h
hYes, in a western block of this continent.
 I believe it was a place called the Supply Core.h
hAlright.h
