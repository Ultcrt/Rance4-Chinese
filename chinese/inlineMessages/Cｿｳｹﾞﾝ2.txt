Itfs a nice meadow with a pleasant breeze.
Itfs a boring meadow with nothing interesting about it.
Ifm tired of looking at towers.
No matter how much I look at them, nothingfs gonna
happen.
Itfs far away.
I wanted to land near there...
Itfs a meadow with a nice breeze.
I canft believe wefre on top of a continent floating in
the sky.
Itfs a nice meadow, not at all different from ones back
on the surface.
hAhh, this feels so nice.
 Letfs just forget about Rance and take a nap here.h
hI suppose. Should we do that?h
hMaria-dono, u—¥-dono, our first priority should be
 completing our mission.h
hYeah, I know.
 I just thought Ifd say it.h
hUwawawawa...!h
hWhat is it, éä»‰ë?h
hI found a weird caaave!
 Look at iiit!h
A large, man-made hole was in the direction éä»‰ë was
pointing.
hWhat is that hole?h
h...Looks like an entrance to something.
 Anyway, looks like therefs an underground.h
hOwah, aaah...!h
hWhat is it, —¢-san?h
hTh.. th.. therefs something behind that rock..!h
hEh? An enemy...?h
While thinking about the enemy attacking, I looked in the
direction of the rock, only to see a single cow appear,
crying hmeow, meow.h
hWhat the, itfs just a cow.
 Geez, —¢-san.h
hIfm, Ifm sorry.h
hWe donft know when monsters will come out, so everyone
 be careful, alright?h
hItfs alright, Maria-dono.
 It doesnft look like there are any enemies in the area.h
hYeah, I donft sense anything.h
hThatfs amazing, —¢-san, Leila-san.
 You can tell?h
hYou know, we HAVE been trained for this.h
hAre there any good women arouuund...!
 Ifm waiting for a beauty..!!h
I shouted in a loud voice.
But no beautiful women appeared.
Where should we go?
The Tulip #4 fell right onto the edge of the continent,
but therefs a possibility of Rance being in the center of
the continent, near that huge tower.
hItfs a little far, but letfs head to that tall tower.h
..............
But on the way, there was a deep trench, and we could
proceed no farther.
hLooks like we need to look for a different route.h
hYeah.h
héä»‰ëfs tiired...
 Tired of walkiing.h
