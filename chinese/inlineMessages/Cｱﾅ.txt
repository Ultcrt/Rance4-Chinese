Itfs an entrance to Ylapufs underground.
This is kind of exciting.
Itfs the exit of the underground.
There arenft any particularly erotic sights to tickle my
fancy around, so itfs boring.
Therefs a huge building.
I didnft think there would be something like this here.
Ylapu definitely had some kind of civilization, donft you
think?
Ifm kind of excited.
Therefs nothing particularly strange about it besides the
fact that itfs an underground entrance.
Itfs an entrance to somewhere.
I wonder if Rance and Šó˜I-chan are in here?
hThis entrance is amazing, isnft it, Rance-sama?
 This alone is bigger than Rance-samafs house.h
hSo what?
 So what if itfs bigger than my house?
 Eh!?h
hUmm... Sorry.h
hHmph.h
Clouds are drifting slowly through the sky.
h*Achoo*.h
hWhat are you doing?h
hWhen I looked at the sky, I had to sneeze.. hehe.
 *Achoo*.h
Itfs the sky... looking at it kind of makes me want to
take a break....
hŠó˜I, wefre taking a break.
 Let me use your lap as a pillow.h
hYes.h
I lay down and rested my head on Šó˜Ifs lap.
Her soft thighs are comfortable.
hLetfs take a one-hour break.h
hYeaaah, éä»‰ëfs tired too!h

We took an hour-long break.
