Ifm in front of the tower on the north part of the
Toushin Toshi.
Itfs a huge tower, but it doesnft seem unusual at all.
Itfs a big door. Tall guys can enter without fear like
this.
hRance-sama, therefs something written next to the door.
 Umm...h
h.....It says,
 fall items found within have already been collectedf.h
hSo I sfpose this tower no longer contains anything of
 value.h
hSeems like it.
 I guess the townspeople have already explored it. Too
 bad.h
hOpen uuup!
 Itfs Rance-sama, open the door!h
*Siiiilent*.
hMakinf a fool af me.h
hHey, Kanami.h
hWhat?h
hYoufre a ninja, so you can easily climb walls, right?
 Climb up this tower and check it out.h
hWell, I can, but....
 What do you want me to check out?h
hLook for birdsf nests.
 There might be weird shells that birds have collected in
 there.h
hShells??
 Why do you need something like that?h
hCollecting unusual shells is Rance-samafs secret hobby.h
hThatfs ridiculous. I wonft do it for a stupid reason
 like that.h
h!!h
hOpeeen!!h
I attempted to open the door with my 1,000,000
horsepower, but the stupid thing didnft even budge.
hDammit, why wonft it open!?h
I donft really feel like doing anything.
Alright, Ifm gonna scribble on this wall.
I scribbled on the wall of the tower.
(Scribble scribble scribble scribble)
